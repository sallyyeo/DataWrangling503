28
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.160
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, hang on, let me figure out how to the screen sharing thing.

29
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.970
INSTRUCTOR: Stop my share.

30
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.060
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, you have to.

31
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.100
STUDENT 01: Give me a second, I have to allow my computer.

32
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.080
INSTRUCTOR: Yes.

33
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.790
STUDENT 01: Share screen.

34
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.330
STUDENT 01: Sorry, you mean.

35
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.580
STUDENT 01: Give me five seconds.

36
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.200
STUDENT 01: Sorry, my MIC settings I need to restart so i'm in La megan.

37
00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.670
STUDENT 01: else.

38
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.050
INSTRUCTOR: Can someone else.

39
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.070
STUDENT 02: I can stop.

40
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.890
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, very good, very good give you.

41
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.900
STUDENT 02: My screen.

42
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.020
STUDENT 02: yeah so the commanded are you.

43
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.630
STUDENT 02: can hear me.

44
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.470
STUDENT 02: yeah so the commanded, I would like to share is a very simple one.

45
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.230
STUDENT 02: very quick disclaimer i'm not sure where the.

46
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:12.570
STUDENT 02: So this command that i'm about to share will be covered in future lessons, but I hope i'm having broken the rules that I only sharing what i've been covered so far so yeah the comedy I like to share today is.

47
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.210
STUDENT 02: The key, the key word distinct policy that common so.

48
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:29.610
STUDENT 02: As we all know and select is used to to to to gather on to retrieve values but oftentimes we own we encounter a situation where.

49
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:49.110
STUDENT 02: Values get it from particular call they have a lot of repeated values so distinct allows us to return own unique values from one or more columns and, as can be seen from the second bullet calling the syntax goes like this select this thing the column name from table name.

50
00:07:50.280 --> 00:08:01.680
STUDENT 02: And next slide yeah, so I will be using the I just use a very random table from the DEMO data set and we'll go from the teaser and.

51
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.710
STUDENT 02: i'm using a typical survey table.

52
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:12.540
STUDENT 02: yeah I have a screenshot here but also show you how we lose by in that table plussing in a minute so.

53
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:21.720
STUDENT 02: yeah you can see my table plus yes, so this is the six years of a.

54
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.570
STUDENT 02: table okay.

55
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:35.670
STUDENT 02: We will be focusing on this column called H for this DEMO you can see, there are a lot of different values in each column.

56
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:48.930
STUDENT 02: I can do a very quick command select commands like age from six years to be and I ran it, I see a lot of different values, so they are taught ios.

57
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.390
STUDENT 02: 7687 rows.

58
00:08:51.630 --> 00:09:11.310
STUDENT 02: means Ellis there will be 736 97 value so you just at a quick glance you see as a default on a tree yeah there's a repeatable right right So how do we get the unique range of ages so very simple you just type select this think age from six year survey, we ran again.

59
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:22.380
STUDENT 02: yeah So there we go 67 so we know that they're actually 67 unique ages collected from the survey from the H column.

60
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.290
STUDENT 02: I think that's basically what i'm trying to share.

61
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.370
STUDENT 02: I have another screenshot here to show what I just.

62
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.930
STUDENT 02: I hope this helps me and not too simple for one.

63
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.670
INSTRUCTOR: I think is good.

64
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.220
INSTRUCTOR: Thank you, thank you, thanks.

65
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.260
STUDENT 02: OK.

66
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.300
INSTRUCTOR: OK.

67
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.500
INSTRUCTOR: Are you still co hosts.

68
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.270
STUDENT 01: So I don't Have a nice presentation share, but I have.

69
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:41.580
STUDENT 01: My table view up just like to kind of talk you through so the one that I picked is create view because part of my struggle with sequel is trying to understand it from a practical practical like epic scalability applicable standpoint versus just like a data.

70
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:51.690
STUDENT 01: tool because that's kind of how I was thinking about in terms of work, so I came across the create view um syntax which is.

71
00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:01.950
STUDENT 01: Which is kind of like that help answer questions because so when you want to show data to, for example, client you don't want them to see the entire database because there might be a lot of.

72
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:12.570
STUDENT 01: privilege or sensitive information on it, so creating view is almost like trading interface for the tables, so it can be thought of like a store query.

73
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:23.190
STUDENT 01: and abuse and saved in the database server so we don't have to copy them over from some other file and creating the view allows like different kind of users to interact with the table so, for example.

74
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:33.690
STUDENT 01: someone like me who's not very familiar with sequel and I can just use the view to just kind of see very basic data or, if you have like a very noisy client, you can prevent them from seeing.

75
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:43.590
STUDENT 01: Things they're not supposed to be seeing or, if you have impatient users, they don't need to see like the if it's a very long, complicated query you can hide that from them and they just see a.

76
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.370
STUDENT 01: very basic.

77
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:54.900
STUDENT 01: table basically and yeah so they're sensitive a private information that not everyone has a lot excellent students with things like credit card numbers, or NIC numbers or contact information.

78
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:06.150
STUDENT 01: And you can pull data from multiple tables using inner join so there's a lot of different it's not very limited it's helpful in terms from.

79
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:19.440
STUDENT 01: Working with our showing data to other people um one of the other benefits, you can create views that include aggregated data for the end users and that's something else that's very interesting so.

80
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.530
STUDENT 01: When I was playing around with this only I used us DEMO data we had from last week so.

81
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:35.730
STUDENT 01: For example, a in this example I pretended like I didn't know I had a client who was interested in selling TV product, so what would be the data they'd be interested in, so I kind of picked a few.

82
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.270
STUDENT 01: Are they married what kind of income they have working not working, what kind of residential status they had so.

83
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:54.150
STUDENT 01: Within so the way you'd write it is create your view name and then you would select the different variables that you want included in and i've just kind of renamed them in the thought process off if I were.

84
00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:02.040
STUDENT 01: Giving this to a client would I want them to type like the variable name, as it is, I want to give them something that's more understandable from their point like.

85
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:16.950
STUDENT 01: If I assume they're as not as knowledgeable as me so and then you would select the source and I came across this with track options, so this comes in handy later if someone wants to add data to the table it's there to.

86
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:24.870
STUDENT 01: Make sure that you've got all the right information, so we would run that and then that would create the table.

87
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:33.630
STUDENT 01: And then, when you want to do your select so the select statement is kind of where the user interface pumps and so now like this is the client side of it, they want to see.

88
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:41.760
STUDENT 01: This information, whereas resident status equals two so they can run that and then they can see the data.

89
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:52.980
STUDENT 01: The thing that's also really good about creating views is they don't just it's not just like a static view of the table, if they want to update the data they're also able to do that, so they can add in a row.

90
00:13:53.730 --> 00:14:02.850
STUDENT 01: Just like inserting value into the view name and what are the column names are inserting the data into and what's the data itself.

91
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:19.290
STUDENT 01: And they can run that and if they go back and run their select from, and you can see a row, has been edited so that's kind of what I did, and then it's very simple to drop the view it's just dropped the view so yeah so that's what I picked.

92
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.940
INSTRUCTOR: Thank you, sorry if i'm fixing my mouth.

93
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.200
INSTRUCTOR: But thank you.

94
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.000

97
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.550
INSTRUCTOR: gonna go Okay, let me give you my screen.

98
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.890
STUDENT 03: See the screen now.

99
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.500
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, yes okay.

100
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.490
STUDENT 03: So what i'd like to share today is actually.

101
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.200
STUDENT 03: How to do a so called pivot function.

102
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:53.730
STUDENT 03: In using sql although unless they are trying to find out why am I really looking for such kind of function is because in Microsoft what usually I when I do with.

103
00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:09.090
STUDENT 03: Data usually I use the X the pivot table in the excel pretty awful, and so this is also something that I would like to find weather is there such kind of function, a vote to see.

104
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.050
STUDENT 03: To use in the sql.

105
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.790
STUDENT 03: So.

106
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.700
STUDENT 03: I can shift.

107
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:28.140
STUDENT 03: So i'm not too sure if you can see the screen is there anything blocking is at the moment.

108
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.300
INSTRUCTOR: I think all your zoom stuff is a scattered around the screen.

109
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:33.630
yeah.

110
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.700
STUDENT 03: i'm not sure how.

111
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.480
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, that thing when we.

112
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.080
STUDENT 03: do not know how to shift.

113
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.740
INSTRUCTOR: Okay mini movie.

114
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.930
INSTRUCTOR: Maybe I don't maximize the screen can.

115
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:07.620
STUDENT 04: You track those molly toby, no one can you just present who in.

116
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.070
STUDENT 04: The whole Bosch of evolution.

117
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.600
STUDENT 03: Anyway, so maybe that means us try to.

118
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.230
INSTRUCTOR: agree the other creaminess and then a drug overdose smaller Oh, this is even when.

119
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.350
STUDENT 03: i'm sorry just give me.

120

INSTRUCTOR: Here we can see, you can see.

125
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.680
STUDENT 03: me I just continually that I saw else mentioning that, because in my costs of what I usually use a pivot function.

126
00:17:50.340 --> 00:18:03.840
STUDENT 03: In excel, so I would like to see whether there is such kind of capability on sql so what I have done is I have used one of datasets phone on the l COs page, which is the enrollment.

127
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.810
STUDENT 03: P one.

INSTRUCTOR: sure.

135
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.550
INSTRUCTOR: You stop share, but then we can still see your screen.

136
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.870
STUDENT 03: there's no stop share function.

137
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.340
STUDENT 03: Sorry.

138
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.000
STUDENT 03: y'all can still see my screen now.

139
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.990
INSTRUCTOR: yep yeah.

140
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.360
STUDENT 03: Okay, and we just.

141
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.810
STUDENT 03: Continue continue that.

142
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.720
STUDENT 03: you're.

143
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.390
STUDENT 03: The functions are not working, when i'm trying to.

144
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.830
INSTRUCTOR: Your left your left click has become a right click.

145
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.370
STUDENT 03: Why can't stop share.

146
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.550
STUDENT 03: Maybe, can I go and come back again.

147
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.630
yeah okay.

148
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.440
INSTRUCTOR: Maybe I should we, you know office.

149
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:07.140
STUDENT 05: yeah yes so also, I do have PowerPoint slides online Skype so i'll just go first in case I don't come back in time after the cheaper.

150
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.320
STUDENT 05: to share screen.

151
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.930
STUDENT 05: Can you see my screen.

152
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.080
INSTRUCTOR: Yes.

153
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:35.430
STUDENT 05: Yes, yeah so today i'll be sharing our on this function, I thought will be quite useful for for me my will also be interesting, and because I totally don't have a background So those are bigger might buy quite simple.

154
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.010
STUDENT 05: For me, is like wow yeah.

155
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:46.680
STUDENT 05: So the functionality sharing is our Union, where we actually combine the results are off to a mockery slack using this Union.

156
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:57.150
STUDENT 05: And so, so when I was reading up on this function, I know that there was there is some basic rule to follow like first, the number and the order of the color must appear.

157
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:07.080
STUDENT 05: appear in the select statement must be the same, and then the data of the columns is almost the same are compatible so actually i'm.

158
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:28.320
STUDENT 05: Just nice use the data that we're going to use today right, so I pick it up, you will be, you can see there's an rfc imbalance and our city our project Citibank and RCM better so actually I tried to Union them, so I select both that data from ub n Citibank and then we just run this.

159
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.110
STUDENT 05: And then you will actually.

160
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.590
STUDENT 05: combine all the data together.

161
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:44.070
STUDENT 05: I thought I would just show, something that will not work so just now, I mentioned that if you don't have the same call them right so.

162
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:45.960
STUDENT 05: Because.

163
00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:00.240
STUDENT 05: i'll pick the soul now before another one, so instead of CT them just cross it off, and I will you be so you can see you, yes, there is like to earn it now, so if I were to do these are it's not going to work.

164
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:13.740
STUDENT 05: That you will see something so are in, then, when I was like trying to function, then I know that if you were to change these like, for example, just people just an ice to.

165
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:26.190
STUDENT 05: And because it's the same data type of so we actually what three ways you combine everything so yeah so that's my short DEMO.

166
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.140
INSTRUCTOR: Thank you.

167
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.360
Okay yeah Thank you.

168
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:42.810
INSTRUCTOR: Rachel.

169
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.680
STUDENT 03: Yes, sorry i'm back, I think I found out what happened just.

170
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.270
Okay.

171
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:50.880
INSTRUCTOR: So.

172
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.750
Okay.

173
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.510
INSTRUCTOR: yeah so we can see your screen.

174
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:13.380
STUDENT 03: Okay, so.

175
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:20.580
STUDENT 03: While, on the show is something that pivot function so way of using the enrollment P one.

176
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.210
STUDENT 03: P bass at this available on the.

177
00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:38.310
STUDENT 03: one page, so this is how it looks like So if you can see the columns here have three different data types one this year, the agenda and the number of enrollment.

178
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:51.990
STUDENT 03: Of premier once a year, so in each row is a serious, it does that by an F, I think this is the total cohort for premier one enrollment and F is the number of females that.

179
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.820
STUDENT 03: Was enrolled in the year.

180
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:54.210
So.

181
00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:08.340
STUDENT 03: Because there is the years are in two different roles, so I would like to actually up to, but the gender into two new columns and have the enrollment segregate that into.

182
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.790
STUDENT 03: Female and photo or number of.

183
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.020
STUDENT 03: enrollments in that year, so what they have done is.

184
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:24.180
STUDENT 03: Firstly, I have selected how I want to show the people S, year by year.

185
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.950
STUDENT 03: female and male so our in this in this.

186
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:48.450
STUDENT 03: line here, I will create a new column mail, which is taking total minus female so, but this is a step that I think last week of my perception shift to this is a mess, but kind of condition so to have this.

187
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:59.040
STUDENT 03: What I have to first make sure that I define what is female and total, so this is where I do the pivot after data in the agenda.

188
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.430
STUDENT 03: In this role in this second column.

189
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:10.650
STUDENT 03: Where I have used the case when function, because I tried to find out there isn't a pivot function in.

190
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:23.370
STUDENT 03: command in sql, so I think this is a alternative that we can use as how to pivot the data into a new column, so I use the case when function.

191
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:39.960
STUDENT 03: Where I was some up a case where X is equal to F, then the enrollment they will pick up the data in the enrollment probably one column else it will be a malfunction so this will be for the condition when it's.

192
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:54.420
STUDENT 03: Female and this second right it's also when the total so and where this data comes from is from the enrollment fee one table which I showed earlier, and to do this also will have the group the.

193
00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:18.240
STUDENT 03: The year so that it will show in each individual for the year so in because this is the first step for the creative people at the back there after creating this new data, then it can run a pickup don't create the new columns as this line here.

194
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.670
STUDENT 03: I also have to create penaflorida new table new.

195
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.690
STUDENT 03: As a new table so that you will show up.

196
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.760
STUDENT 03: In this format.

197
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.050
STUDENT 03: So this is how I can so call give us this data into a new format in this way.

198
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.860
STUDENT 03: So that's what I would like to share today.

199
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.990
INSTRUCTOR: Very cool Thank you.

200
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.020
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

201
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:36.780
INSTRUCTOR: So actually country for two more after the break unless the to hear want to do it now that's fine also let me know so in the meantime, let me just pick up on a couple of things which are your classmates mention it, so the first one.

202
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:41.850
Is.

203
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.270
INSTRUCTOR: i'm.

204
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.070
STUDENT 02: like this is from 60 years serving.

205
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.660
INSTRUCTOR: tables excessively.

206
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.670
INSTRUCTOR: yeah yeah i've been added here.

207
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.160
INSTRUCTOR: Let me.

208
00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.610
Go to.

209
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.010
file.

210
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.960
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

211
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.420
INSTRUCTOR: So we said 67 rules right.

212
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:29.880
STUDENT 02: Yes.

213
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.790
INSTRUCTOR: So, depending on.

214
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:44.490
INSTRUCTOR: Depending on okay it's Okay, I want to show you a trick.

215
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:50.820
INSTRUCTOR: So if you're an order, then you just do order by okay.

216
00:29:54.150 --> 00:30:00.390
INSTRUCTOR: Then, then it's presented in descending order right so last week we knew that.

217
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.240
INSTRUCTOR: Think Jacqueline brought it up.

218
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:10.230
INSTRUCTOR: You and descending order, then you have the dsc command right and everything is set up.

219
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.000
INSTRUCTOR: If he happens to be text.

220
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.910
INSTRUCTOR: Right so there's there's a quick fix for that so.

221
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:26.940
INSTRUCTOR: I don't have a text but imagine if each word text and then.

222
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.700
INSTRUCTOR: You wanted to order it then you just do plus zero.

223
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:49.470
INSTRUCTOR: Then this thing itself on the fly or convert your text each into numeric and then the ordering look yeah so that's one trick lot, but in this case it doesn't make a difference because it's already numeric type.

224
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:56.520
INSTRUCTOR: get anything I want to show which is similar to what Rachel just mentioned.

225
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.500
INSTRUCTOR: Is you can combine this with a group by.

226
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.090
INSTRUCTOR: So you are selecting.

227
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.150
INSTRUCTOR: ish.

228
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.250
INSTRUCTOR: And then that's a star.

229
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.070
INSTRUCTOR: So this gives you kind of like a text histogram.

230
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:38.100
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, of the different ages Okay, and then, of course, you know costumer will be better if we.

231
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:55.200
INSTRUCTOR: So, so what this is is that the 884 rules where each values at the hundred 66 rows each release 19 so so far right, so you can see her up like a histogram of.

232
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.280
INSTRUCTOR: Well, can I, to be strict about chat.

233
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:09.810
INSTRUCTOR: For the different age ranges that so it can see like either high energy at for the only 7 billion people so forth okay so so.

234
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:14.640
INSTRUCTOR: So.

235
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:28.680
INSTRUCTOR: distinct essentially distinct will throw away all the duplicates when you buy it groups by distinct values of what of the grouping column.

236
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:50.130
INSTRUCTOR: So it's similar in that sense, but it also allows you to accumulate other things that are like other metrics that are associated with each group so once again each group is a unique value of your grouping column or columns you can group by combinations of columns as well yeah.

237
00:32:51.300 --> 00:33:10.290
INSTRUCTOR: So imagine if you, you know sales director, then you can buy salesperson or you know you can group by region or I can group by salesperson with format right depending on sales format so many different things, you can do to see to try to tease apart people's performance yeah.

238
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:24.330
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so I wanted to bring this up and show the connection between at least the similarities and differences between distinct and goodbye okay so let's start the lesson.

239
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:28.710
Okay.

240
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.410
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so you're covered.

241
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:47.580
INSTRUCTOR: unions joins group by right and there's a section in the back of this deck which i'll share data that shows you essential information that you might need to know might be good to know about data types and functions.

242
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:54.360
INSTRUCTOR: So select statement, so if you read the documentation.

243
00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.780
INSTRUCTOR: For like, for my sql you'll see something like this, so.

244
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.610
INSTRUCTOR: So all programming languages have a grammar.

245
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:20.430
INSTRUCTOR: yeah grammatical rules for every programming language and essentially what what the documentation that you read for any programming language tries to do is try to explain.

246
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:34.530
INSTRUCTOR: and remove any ambiguity about how you use this in text you know how do you express yourself in that language yeah so because all programming languages, need to be interpreted by a computer.

247
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.590
INSTRUCTOR: There is a there's no room for ambiguity.

248
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:48.210
INSTRUCTOR: Like English in English or in spoken languages there's always some room for ambiguity and that's where humor shows up.

249
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:50.670
INSTRUCTOR: So.

250
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:58.530
INSTRUCTOR: Let me try to so the square brackets you see here optional things yeah.

251
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.600
INSTRUCTOR: If you see a square bracket at a comma dot dot dot like the ellipses in the square brackets, that means the previous.

252
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:15.660
INSTRUCTOR: token, the previous expression can be repeated multiple times, but you need a comma, and so in this case.

253
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:26.730
INSTRUCTOR: You can think of these as columns law So the first thing is you select the columns you want right, so this column one, then, if you add more than one column, then you always separate them with a comma.

254
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:39.540
INSTRUCTOR: So same thing here group, by then, you see there's a comma and three dots yeah so ascending descending the pipe symbol, the vertical line.

255
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.160
INSTRUCTOR: Was it.

256
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:58.680
INSTRUCTOR: was going to give you a keyboard position, but I think it's different for different keywords the vertical line is our logical so that means you can see, you can include ascending or descending but you cannot have both right.

257
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.040
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so, so let me try to explain this.

258
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:22.530
INSTRUCTOR: In something more understandable, so you can think of this basic structure but select query as you want to select the columns that you want to appear in your results table from one or more data sources.

259
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:31.530
INSTRUCTOR: were so this is a rotor tiller where some real conditions are true, so you only show those rules sorry, so this is a.

260
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:38.910
INSTRUCTOR: row filter grouping by one or more columns if you want to use a goodbye yeah.

261
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:50.190
INSTRUCTOR: Having so having is a rule filter that is a pipe after the grouping function runs and that.

262
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:58.140
INSTRUCTOR: So yeah so imagine you have goodbye right, so this right will give you a result stable.

263
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:13.290
INSTRUCTOR: If you have having What it does is that that results table the first four rows of commands it will then do a roll filter on the results people based on why value you specify here.

264
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:34.140
INSTRUCTOR: order by so how you want to order the rules, the presentation of yours right limit so let's say you're only interested in the top 10 or the bottom 10, then you can specify that limit so imagine if I wanted.

265
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.540
INSTRUCTOR: A simple thing to do.

266
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:46.950
INSTRUCTOR: So, so I buy them.

267
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.630
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so I.

268
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.840
INSTRUCTOR: say I want to only see the top five.

269
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.930
INSTRUCTOR: Or the five most.

270
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:10.050
INSTRUCTOR: Frequent ages most common ages in the dsa, so I do limit five yeah.

271
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.160
yeah.

272
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:27.870
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so, so this is so, for the purpose of this course, especially for people who have not been exposed to much sql before or, if you have maybe just been treating other people so could.

273
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:39.420
INSTRUCTOR: You think of the select query in in this structure, so I can repeat the summertime because you can get this and I think everything else is just understanding.

274
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:49.530
INSTRUCTOR: or seeing examples of I can do that so So the first line, can you think of it as multiple lines select the columns that you want to appear in your results table.

275
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:58.560
INSTRUCTOR: And then, where do you get the data from from these columns from from my nobody resources right, so it could be tables could be some queries you unless the queries.

276
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:08.880
INSTRUCTOR: That generate tables on the fly could be views that you create it from existing tables right so many different ways to get data in pain with.

277
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.820
INSTRUCTOR: apply some rule condition.

278
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:20.340
INSTRUCTOR: Especially if you're pulling from multiple tables, you need to specify rule conditions little I explain why yeah.

279
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:28.440
INSTRUCTOR: So grouping by one or more columns if you need to reduce and summarize.

280
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:46.740
INSTRUCTOR: Very large table into I guess specific indicators for each subset or segment of the entire table right so when you use group by that's what you're doing you are saying that.

281
00:39:47.160 --> 00:40:04.350
INSTRUCTOR: Your whole table actually is broken up into a few groups and how do I know how to define a group, so I should I say, you know, is a unique value of weibo the columns Allah so could be location could be area could be you know postal code could be.

282
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.220
INSTRUCTOR: income bracket many different things yeah.

283
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:17.790
INSTRUCTOR: So the having again having is a rule filter just like where is the road filter but they're having will filter occurs after your grouping.

284
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:34.830
INSTRUCTOR: So, remember that when you grew by like when you create groups all your reporting all you're allowed to report is one line of information for the entire group so if you grew by income bracket.

285
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:49.920
INSTRUCTOR: You what you can do is you can report things like summary statistics so things like you know average income well that doesn't make sense, because the income bracket so like maybe average family size, you know.

286
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.050
INSTRUCTOR: What else could be like.

287
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.110
INSTRUCTOR: modal.

288
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.690
INSTRUCTOR: The most common places where they live, you know.

289
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:13.950
INSTRUCTOR: moodle median educational status, you know many different things that you can report, but then it's just one line of information.

290
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.830
INSTRUCTOR: So this.

291
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:32.790
INSTRUCTOR: This rule right these four lines your create results table that has as many lives as many roles as they are groups so each row in your results table represents one group, and then the columns represent.

292
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:40.860
INSTRUCTOR: The pieces of information or the indicators are the metrics that you want to report for each true.

293
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:53.910
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so you cannot report body, it has to be we call it aggregate functions or results of aggregate functions okay so then having you can then say you know you want.

294
00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:06.000
INSTRUCTOR: It is this examples about by income record and you want families, you know that are larger than a certain amount such a certain number of things that and all those will be.

295
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.850
INSTRUCTOR: Real I guess be computed.

296
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.940
INSTRUCTOR: From the summary tables.

297
00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:26.100
INSTRUCTOR: From as charity after the first four rows, then you can order the you can change your presentation order and then you can again I say limit truncate the table.

298
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.490
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

299
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:44.610
INSTRUCTOR: So you can night, I guess, I mentioned just now, you can select from multiple tables and combine the data from multiple tables and today we will go through simple examples of.

300
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:50.520
INSTRUCTOR: The tiny tables that you download an important yeah.

301
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.450
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so Union so you can play along with this, and I say a lot, I mean.

302
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:07.200
INSTRUCTOR: You can type your own query in because he had now have the same the exact same tables then.

303
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:08.580
INSTRUCTOR: here.

304
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.880
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

305
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.120
INSTRUCTOR: me put a semi colon.

306
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:36.030
INSTRUCTOR: yeah right So if you wanted to step, one on top of the other.

307
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.990
INSTRUCTOR: You can combine them into a single.

308
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.800
INSTRUCTOR: Statement single command so yeah but yeah but select.

309
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:58.470
INSTRUCTOR: I see and balance from your be and then you ever selecting it balance from dbs and in between that we put in all this, so what happens is it will return.

310
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:19.560
INSTRUCTOR: The results of the first select statement and step, the second select statement and then need a pen and okay so and in the slides I just color Code, the data from each table, so it can see what happens so if you fit the order then.

311
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.540
INSTRUCTOR: That it gets skipped here and there is up stable okay.

312
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.370
INSTRUCTOR: So.

313
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.620
INSTRUCTOR: So let's see, let me just check yes.

314
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.050
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, different.

315
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:48.090
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

316
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.090
INSTRUCTOR: You could do this.

317
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.180
INSTRUCTOR: And then, it just gives you double of everything.

318
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.570
INSTRUCTOR: Right is the dbs stable, secondly dbs table you could do this.

319
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.070
INSTRUCTOR: and add triple right, so you can just keep Union in all.

320
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.370
INSTRUCTOR: As many times, as you want, you know it'll just keep stacking more and more.

321
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.820
INSTRUCTOR: I guess tables what I thought the other.

322
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.170
STUDENT 01: Sorry, I have a question but, so this is only.

323
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:36.330
STUDENT 01: This is running under the assumption that all the column names are identical right.

324
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:45.570
INSTRUCTOR: Oh no it doesn't have to be same column names, but it needs to be seen, are compatible types okay so it's a good question.

325
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.700
INSTRUCTOR: So in this case I just keep saying.

326
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.090
INSTRUCTOR: I see bands, I see balance right so let's say I create a new table.

327
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.340
INSTRUCTOR: OK, so now I have GPS, to table.

328
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:37.410
INSTRUCTOR: The column names are different from the dbs table yeah so then now if I say select.

329
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.510
INSTRUCTOR: And I see balance from yes.

330
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.060
INSTRUCTOR: All.

331
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.120
INSTRUCTOR: Like ID.

332
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.840
INSTRUCTOR: From PBS true.

333
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:54.390
INSTRUCTOR: It still shows up.

334
00:46:55.950 --> 00:47:00.510
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so that the danger about.

335
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:13.620
INSTRUCTOR: Union all is that it realtors blindly follow your instructions and step things so you need to make sure that it makes sense, the second.

336
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:19.710
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

337
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:29.730
INSTRUCTOR: I saw jack ask a question right so jack your question, we will address later, when we look at joins yeah but it's a good question yeah.

338
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.170
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

339
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.750
INSTRUCTOR: So.

340
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.520
INSTRUCTOR: I hope this is clear yeah.

341
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:45.930
INSTRUCTOR: Yes.

342
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:48.870
STUDENT 06: In this case.

343
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.950
STUDENT 06: Will we be able to.

344
00:47:54.750 --> 00:48:01.050
STUDENT 06: Do filtering of the data set after you Union of this.

345
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:02.820
STUDENT 06: Because.

346
00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:03.690
The.

347
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.410
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, after you might not be fired it.

348
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:18.630
STUDENT 06: After so like you joined to the process to get because right now we're like me like know where where function in goodbye we're not.

349
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:25.470
STUDENT 06: In the dbs table or the Ob table it will just be a subset of better right.

350
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:26.460
STUDENT 06: yeah.

351
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:36.930
STUDENT 06: You could literally double double the commands for your end bs but would it be possible to do it as a table by itself.

352
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.600
STUDENT 06: I said he will.

353
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.330
STUDENT 06: OK cool.

354
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:47.460
STUDENT 06: OK.

355
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:56.850
INSTRUCTOR: OK, so you can ness.

356
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:05.250
INSTRUCTOR: Your your this I mean query and then so when you put brackets around it, you need to give it a name.

357
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:10.890
INSTRUCTOR: So you can call it, anything that usually you'll do a as a BSC over.

358
00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:21.210
INSTRUCTOR: Then you can use this as this whole thing is almost like a temporary table, so you select from this temporary table, and then you can apply a filter were like.

359
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:32.220
STUDENT 07: let's say I have killed the database or the same column, so how is there any short form to combine everything together.

360
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.120
Instead of just.

361
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:46.980
INSTRUCTOR: Well okay everybody let's see okay extremely extreme you had to be 100 datasets and actually to Union, all of them, then I wouldn't do this by hand I would.

362
00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:52.950
INSTRUCTOR: I would write a script in Python on our that will.

363
00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:11.700
INSTRUCTOR: go into your database pull out the names of the tables and construct a query programmatically and then execute execute it, you know and started in a new this combine massive table, you know as a new table in the database now so but.

364
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:21.420
INSTRUCTOR: I don't think there's like a shortcut you know where you can see style you know select from stars and they get it, I don't think it works every day.

365
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.940
STUDENT 07: Yes, it is 50 columns is there anything yeah sure.

366
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:33.630
INSTRUCTOR: So 50 columns depends on how much of a risk taker you so.

367
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.860
INSTRUCTOR: You can always use the star.

368
00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:47.070
INSTRUCTOR: If you are very sure.

369
00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.550
INSTRUCTOR: They are the same.

370
00:50:52.500 --> 00:51:00.270
INSTRUCTOR: You have the exact same number of columns and are compatible right and not that someone makes the order of the columns.

371
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:10.740
INSTRUCTOR: On you yeah so, but if you're very sure about the structure of all your tables, then you do need to type up the columns explicitly you can you say started to see all.

372
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.680
INSTRUCTOR: My goodness this cat is terrible.

373
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.640
INSTRUCTOR: yeah so.

374
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:21.450
INSTRUCTOR: Is that Tara.

375
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.790
STUDENT 07: yeah so in between fantastic candy shop, which has put.

376
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:29.670
STUDENT 07: A marketplace.

377
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.550
INSTRUCTOR: That you need like a where line is it.

378
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:39.300
STUDENT 07: I yeah so let's say I treated on Sep 20 columns and now let's go to a few other columns people.

379
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:43.740
INSTRUCTOR: Oh.

380
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:51.630
INSTRUCTOR: Well, if it's only for one table, then you can you can do it here let's see where.

381
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.870
STUDENT 07: I mean there's let's say four tables 50 columns.

382
00:51:55.110 --> 00:52:00.540
STUDENT 07: So I need to come back here we do bear that's one column they stopped doing it is, let me.

383
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.030
INSTRUCTOR: Combine everything one car, so you only won.

384
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:12.630
INSTRUCTOR: The race, so you want all the columns but then you wrote.

385
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:21.630
STUDENT 07: Oh well, 60 columns to combine I don't need those days before planes when he says that all of the columns.

386
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:32.010
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, then I was good, at the end so like earlier earlier question about how to do a row filter, so I would I would do like that right.

387
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:32.580
So.

388
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.760
INSTRUCTOR: yeah, then you select.

389
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:44.130
INSTRUCTOR: From this whole mess right is a temporary table and where.

390
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:48.990
INSTRUCTOR: Whichever column you're interested in.

391
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.560
INSTRUCTOR: Is not blank right or is.

392
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:54.030
STUDENT 07: It still.

393
00:52:54.810 --> 00:53:18.690
INSTRUCTOR: Is not blank is not now yeah assuming that blank spent her could is now in your in your table is quoted as just you know empty I see, then you can you can call it right so it's not it's nothing it's like so depending on how it's called that yeah.

394
00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:19.830
STUDENT 07: yeah understood.

395
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.470
Okay race.

396
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:43.830
INSTRUCTOR: yeah jack I understand your question so uh we will will get about joining, so we will talk about it in a slide up to okay so that's Union.

397
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.610
INSTRUCTOR: Jacks question okay.

398
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:49.620
INSTRUCTOR: So intersection.

399
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.900
INSTRUCTOR: So.

400
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:53.970
INSTRUCTOR: So intersection right.

401
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:10.530
INSTRUCTOR: intersection strictly speaking from prospect theory it just means the exact overlap between two tables Okay, then that means.

402
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:22.680
INSTRUCTOR: So this is a very Okay, and this is not strictly speak this is like a very strict version of a joint Okay, where the values for all the columns for all the tables match up.

403
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.610
INSTRUCTOR: So so.

404
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.640
INSTRUCTOR: city.

405
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.170
INSTRUCTOR: And I see balance.

406
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.040
INSTRUCTOR: From.

407
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:40.740
The.

408
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:43.800
INSTRUCTOR: PC.

409
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:48.240
INSTRUCTOR: If he.

410
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.010
INSTRUCTOR: Calls hsbc and see.

411
00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:01.560
INSTRUCTOR: city balance because hsbc balance okay so.

412
00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:04.770
INSTRUCTOR: There is boxes that you see okay.

413
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:07.740
INSTRUCTOR: So.

414
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.830
INSTRUCTOR: In this case.

415
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:27.630
INSTRUCTOR: Is a it's kind of like a contrived example where you have people with accounting to banks with exactly the same balances kind of I unless people purposely do this, you should not see this in real life yeah.

416
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:32.460
INSTRUCTOR: So notice that when.

417
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.380
INSTRUCTOR: We are pulling from more than one people okay.

418
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.970
INSTRUCTOR: What happens, you can try this at home.

419
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.480
INSTRUCTOR: If you remove the were like.

420
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.050
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, then you see why I went to resolve stable.

421
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.850
INSTRUCTOR: Suddenly, your results table have nine routes.

422
00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:00.510
INSTRUCTOR: So, and then you can really tell what's going on, because i'm only pulling the information from the city table.

423
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:30.630
INSTRUCTOR: What happens when you pull when you specify.

424
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:35.940
INSTRUCTOR: More than one table and the from line without anywhere like.

425
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.970
STUDENT 06: looks like it was being caused by side to side.

426
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:51.180
INSTRUCTOR: Explain a bit more.

427
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.820
STUDENT 06: Because they are now from the syllabus on the select.

428
00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:08.160
STUDENT 06: statement you are selecting four columns, so there are there are two columns that belong to CP and true colors they will not be hsbc so.

429
00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:20.610
STUDENT 06: In that sense, the first two columns that you see you see it, so if our okay so so in the end, because in the first column, you have to specify which.

430
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:41.010
STUDENT 06: table belongs to, if not it doesn't know where to pull the NIC, on balance, because it appears on both table, so it looks like you're specifying the banks in the US yeah right so then subsequently from the two tables, which is CBS NBC okay.

431
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:58.410
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, Okay, so I exactly so here I specified table name in front of the column name just to remove the ambiguity, because the nri see column occurs in both the city bank table and the hsbc table simple balance so you need to remove ambiguity.

432
00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:10.620
INSTRUCTOR: by specifying the table name explicitly, so the balance column from the city table that's how that's how he says, right here, so my my question right is how come the nine euros.

433
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:15.510
INSTRUCTOR: free time yes yeah yeah.

434
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:28.470
STUDENT 08: it's a combination of or tree matching each individual column rose to the one from one individual city columns to one.

435
00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:30.630
STUDENT 08: hsbc column.

436
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:34.860
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, so.

437
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:37.140
INSTRUCTOR: If.

438
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:43.440
INSTRUCTOR: it's a partition product so essentially it's it's.

439
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:52.560
INSTRUCTOR: Combining unique values on every different rule every rule in one people with every rule in another table.

440
00:58:53.790 --> 00:59:00.210
INSTRUCTOR: Right so because he because there is no clear line that tells the actual engine.

441
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.800
INSTRUCTOR: How how the rules are related to each other.

442
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:07.620
INSTRUCTOR: So, because we are not explicitly.

443
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:17.760
INSTRUCTOR: specified the relationship between the rules across the different tables the engine to say okay every rule can belong to every other rule.

444
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:23.730
INSTRUCTOR: You know everyone this label can belong to anyone this table that's why it's doing it's just matching up.

445
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:36.630
INSTRUCTOR: The first rule in the city table with each of the roads in hsbc table the second row into the table, if you should was initially stable that that role city each of the rotations we see that's why you have nine rose.

446
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.780
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so this is.

447
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:44.820
INSTRUCTOR: A Cartesian product right so.

448
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.330
INSTRUCTOR: Then we test.

449
00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:53.970
INSTRUCTOR: When we have the hairline.

450
00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:58.410
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so if you're pulling from multiple data sources.

451
01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:10.320
INSTRUCTOR: The way line specifies the relationship between the rows of the between the tables rose from one table and how they relate it wasn't a table so that.

452
01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:24.630
INSTRUCTOR: What shows up essentially is makes sense law, because in most cases, you know every possible combination of rules remind people to not evil is not what you like.

453
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:33.540
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

454
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.540
INSTRUCTOR: I think he was asked a question about the thought right.

455
01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:41.490
INSTRUCTOR: So, so this.

456
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.450
INSTRUCTOR: is having the thought here.

457
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:54.360
INSTRUCTOR: is actually is saying that the column is actually from this table and that's what that.

458
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.910
INSTRUCTOR: Is for yeah.

459
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:02.610
The.

460
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.490
STUDENT 09: Two tables having different types of column names, so should we still put the table name.

461
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:10.800
STUDENT 09: Let me see.

462
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.000
STUDENT 09: Only presenting on.

463
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:12.960
Okay.

464
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.210
INSTRUCTOR: Then no you don't need to.

465
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:16.800
INSTRUCTOR: Very good.

466
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.590
STUDENT 09: Okay Okay, thank you yeah.

467
01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:28.590
INSTRUCTOR: So the dbs and dbs right so select in our right see balance.

468
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.470
INSTRUCTOR: What do we call it ID network.

469
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.230
INSTRUCTOR: From EBS yes true.

470
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:55.950
INSTRUCTOR: So, because there's no ambiguity here you don't need to go the p s nri R ic dbs balance DPS to ID.

471
01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:01.470
INSTRUCTOR: ups, who got network is it you see the same thing, but you don't need to.

472
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.040
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

473
01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:11.760
INSTRUCTOR: So.

474
01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.040
INSTRUCTOR: Let me modified.

475
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.660
INSTRUCTOR: skip a hit show you.

476
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.170
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so that is what we just spoke about yeah.

477
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:55.740
INSTRUCTOR: So every every so they're combining every row in one cable every row in the table, so this case that three rows here to Rosa so it becomes six rows yeah.

478
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:03.570
INSTRUCTOR: yep.

479
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:09.600
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

480
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.710
INSTRUCTOR: So.

481
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:28.140
INSTRUCTOR: um i'm just gonna run through these ones little game, you can play with, because these are very simple projection is that theory just means cutting down the number of dimensions.

482
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.810
INSTRUCTOR: So from in this case three dimensions dimensions so.

483
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:51.270
INSTRUCTOR: selection and set theory is cutting down number grows so it's like playing a role filter so all this is just if you're familiar with that theory, then at least this helps you met the different commands are the types of things you can do with an sql you know maps this area so but.

484
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.100
INSTRUCTOR: I think I understood the examples of these things make sense.

485
01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.120
INSTRUCTOR: OK, so now in a dry okay.

486
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:14.760
INSTRUCTOR: So just check had a question about combining are having multiple of the balances for multiple banks on the same line yeah.

487
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:19.530
INSTRUCTOR: So let's see you I looks like so.

488
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:06.690
INSTRUCTOR: So.

489
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:15.420
INSTRUCTOR: Again, we are pulling from from different tables if we didn't have the queer line movie.

490
01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:29.340
INSTRUCTOR: do the same thing for Cartesian product so notice nine euros right three times three so every combining every row in one table every rule and get a table.

491
01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:40.320
INSTRUCTOR: Right so, but in this case, we know that the rules on you should be combined if they have the same ID number so and that's what we are seeing.

492
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:49.140
INSTRUCTOR: If it numbers are the same across the road that's when you want is that those are the only ones that you haven't seen the results table everything else you throw away because it doesn't make sense.

493
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:50.550
INSTRUCTOR: yeah.

494
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:53.100
INSTRUCTOR: So.

495
01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:57.450
INSTRUCTOR: Actually, at this point right Okay, and let me remove this.

496
01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.040
INSTRUCTOR: Some.

497
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.970
INSTRUCTOR: So you look at lines, two and three.

498
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.290
INSTRUCTOR: by specifying this.

499
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:12.900
INSTRUCTOR: You have access to any column in either table.

500
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:19.590
INSTRUCTOR: So I can just stop and they do just show.

501
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:31.590
INSTRUCTOR: So jack what you want is the outer dry yeah later we'll talk about it okay.

502
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.860
INSTRUCTOR: So.

503
01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:57.210
INSTRUCTOR: So I can say any column right so stylized while that selects all columns available from the data sources that you're pulling from so essentially I my my thing this has exposed all the columns to be a lot of Mila so in this case actually I.

504
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:03.960
INSTRUCTOR: I don't need to see the ice number called twice, because they will share the same value yeah.

505
01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.750
INSTRUCTOR: Okay questions about this.

506
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:48.540
STUDENT 06: hi Marcus um I, I do have a question, so I was just wondering why the system is in this manner.

507
01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.160
STUDENT 06: Is there, like a use for.

508
01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.830
STUDENT 06: The way the join works not I mean not giant is in use.

509
01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:02.340
STUDENT 06: for something like what you just showed that there's no.

510
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:05.010
STUDENT 06: They can win yeah like, why does.

511
01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:10.920
INSTRUCTOR: The Cartesian product right, yes, yes okay so.

512
01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:19.650
INSTRUCTOR: Kathy same product.

513
01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:25.350
INSTRUCTOR: So there's a practical use for it imagine if you had.

514
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:41.610
INSTRUCTOR: You had a matrix that you wanted to construct right so and then you fill that that, let me rephrase myself, maybe have a table, you know construct and you had to fill the table up with stuff so it could be.

515
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.710
INSTRUCTOR: You wanted to see every unique combination of salesperson and region.

516
01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:56.220
INSTRUCTOR: or salesperson and I get sales for me right, so, then you have one table with the list of sales people's names and then another table.

517
01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:06.870
INSTRUCTOR: This of sales format and then many to Cartesian product, then he will then create this we call it a long format table where every unique combination of salesperson and.

518
01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:15.330
INSTRUCTOR: Sales form it shows up in Israel so so, but those users are few and far between.

519
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.510
INSTRUCTOR: So, but the reason why we teach.

520
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:30.570
INSTRUCTOR: Our always useful to understand how the Cartesian product works, yes, because every time you do a join where there's a you know join our join it.

521
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:34.200
INSTRUCTOR: should address billy's question in the chat.

522
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:45.120
INSTRUCTOR: This kind of the right combination combining different tables, you can think of it as the seo engine is doing a Cartesian product as a first step.

523
01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:47.310
STUDENT 06: Right and.

524
01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:59.400
INSTRUCTOR: Then yeah and then, when you apply to your role filter then it throws that we start throwing away all the rules that don't make sense and only only there was that makes sense, as specified on the rare condition.

525
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.810
INSTRUCTOR: will survive fly and shop in your is not stable right.

526
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.910
INSTRUCTOR: So.

527
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.300
INSTRUCTOR: Sometimes.

528
01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.510
INSTRUCTOR: When i'm teaching programming.

529
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:27.840
INSTRUCTOR: Here hear students, especially very seldom graduate students typically undergraduate students at some point they'll see Prof my copyrights hanging right because essentially.

530
01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:37.800
INSTRUCTOR: They wouldn't do something like this Okay, because it's rated we thought they were line it becomes a Cartesian product but.

531
01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:51.540
INSTRUCTOR: They were line that's not pin down fully the relationship between rules on one table it was another table, and then you, you get kind of a Cartesian product on the remainder.

532
01:10:52.440 --> 01:11:04.770
INSTRUCTOR: So, and then you know our tables now three rows each I imagine if you had a table with you know 100,000 rows each your computer hangar so.

533
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:25.890
INSTRUCTOR: So it's very useful to appreciate how sql does the work in the in the background, you know before it shows up on your your query window, so that you try as high as possible not to do it catches it butter in it, but then the right by.

534
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.610
INSTRUCTOR: specifying the relationships pinning down relationship between rose from one to another, I hope that kind of.

535
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.120
STUDENT 06: yeah yeah absolutely thanks thanks.

536
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:39.690
INSTRUCTOR: Thank you.

537
01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:40.890
STUDENT 07: Sorry.

538
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:46.140
STUDENT 07: If I want to do this right now how how to do that combining hsbc or mind.

539
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:47.400
STUDENT 07: view so model gather.

540
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.830
INSTRUCTOR: them together.

541
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.650
STUDENT 07: A month, so any opinion I see and it.

542
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:58.140
STUDENT 07: was just a blast yeah.

543
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:02.730
STUDENT 07: Okay, thank you.

544
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:03.780
Okay.

545
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:07.170
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

546
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.410
INSTRUCTOR: So we can do.

547
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.170
INSTRUCTOR: You can change the keywords.

548
01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:32.850
INSTRUCTOR: And is the same really yeah So if you want to structure it with the drawing key way then instead of a clear line, you need to on.

549
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.590
INSTRUCTOR: So table one in a joint table to on an index how you specify the rule conditions.

550
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.550
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so this is just a different way to express the same thing that.

551
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.080
INSTRUCTOR: I have a.

552
01:12:51.270 --> 01:13:01.830
INSTRUCTOR: preference for the queer line but that's just my personal preference So if you all, if you are familiar with using the join them, you can use it in a joint approach yeah.

553
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.480
INSTRUCTOR: And you show tables.

554
01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:12.570
INSTRUCTOR: So you describe all peoples.

555
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.660
INSTRUCTOR: Okay depends on what you mean by described law.

556
01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.560
INSTRUCTOR: So when you do this quite right.

557
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:31.290
INSTRUCTOR: It shows essentially the structure of the table right the data types and all right when you use show tables.

558
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:38.310
INSTRUCTOR: It just list the names of the tables in the current database yeah.

559
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.980
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

560
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:50.280
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, oh I explained it haha okay so.

561
01:13:52.110 --> 01:14:06.240
INSTRUCTOR: So, in a giant explanation, so it says, if you break it down to three steps, the first step is the sql engine does a Cartesian product combining each row in the USA, both issue and initial cce table.

562
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:10.350
INSTRUCTOR: Then.

563
01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:23.250
INSTRUCTOR: looks at the rule filter right and then it's actually only the rules that satisfied a row filter shows up in the results stable.

564
01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:41.010
INSTRUCTOR: So yeah and then the second one is it does a column filter right because we didn't say star right initial our initial thing was the US and REC agency balance so and that's what happens and then cut standard columns.

565
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:52.950
INSTRUCTOR: Okay um any questions about this before we move on.

566
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:05.100
INSTRUCTOR: Okay left out the joy okay.

567
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:07.980
INSTRUCTOR: So imagine.

568
01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:23.790
INSTRUCTOR: If you work for Postbank right so, but you want to see of all your postpaid customers, the balances of anyone who has an HP account.

569
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.090
INSTRUCTOR: But when you do under drop.

570
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:30.510
INSTRUCTOR: You don't want to lose any.

571
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:38.790
INSTRUCTOR: any of them without rgb account so then he tried to make this.

572
01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:40.710
INSTRUCTOR: Right.

573
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:44.760
Okay.

574
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:16.620
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so we did this right this the inner join approach yeah.

575
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:24.810
INSTRUCTOR: We know that post dang has for customers, but only to survive the query.

576
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:32.580
INSTRUCTOR: Because i'm only showing right look at my real condition only when.

577
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.050
INSTRUCTOR: The prospect, I see number is the same as our HP I see number So those are the only rose i'm sure.

578
01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:45.120
INSTRUCTOR: So, so this is equivalent to add in a joiner right.

579
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:54.390
INSTRUCTOR: So, but as the as the manager in Postbank I won I don't want to lose information about my other customers right.

580
01:16:55.470 --> 01:17:00.240
INSTRUCTOR: So what I do is I do this death out the joy.

581
01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:19.830
INSTRUCTOR: So, so what led the other joined us is that it uses the Left table to the left or the right, left table as the base.

582
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:40.140
INSTRUCTOR: So, and then it takes on information from the right table where there is information it has no information, then it will just happen missing value placeholder now into cells right, so I could have so remember I have all the information in the Left table.

583
01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:51.930
INSTRUCTOR: So I can report anything that people.

584
01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:03.480
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

585
01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.770
INSTRUCTOR: it's 10 o'clock now why don't we take.

586
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.060
INSTRUCTOR: A.

587
01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:15.330
INSTRUCTOR: 10 minute break so yeah so come back at about 1010 yeah.

588
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.610
INSTRUCTOR: If many columns.

589
01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.130
INSTRUCTOR: Of the trade show indicate the ice.

590
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.650
INSTRUCTOR: Right now we are joining on it number yeah especially, I think that.

591
01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.570
INSTRUCTOR: We can add more and more here.

592
01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.370
INSTRUCTOR: So jack depending on where which table the columns come from.

593
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:21.810
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, why don't we take a break now.

594
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:29.970
INSTRUCTOR: Now we got name I see balance headphone yeah so we can just keep adding Hella.

595
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.070
INSTRUCTOR: me.

596
01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:41.880
INSTRUCTOR: phone because I see here the right and the balances, so if if these things.

597
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.720
INSTRUCTOR: present in the tables, then they will sure.

598
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:47.460
INSTRUCTOR: yeah.

599
01:19:52.680 --> 01:20:03.330
INSTRUCTOR: If they are present in both tables, they just need to see which table we went from just like the ice is present in both tables yeah yes i'm not sure if i'm answering your question but i'm.

600
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:10.620
INSTRUCTOR: position and joining sorry guys, as I see this is like the first column, as I see.

601
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:16.350
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so the second and that lines.

602
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:24.870
INSTRUCTOR: You don't need to specify just because this I see here you didn't eat spicy as the first column yeah.

603
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:33.930
INSTRUCTOR: So you can yes, you can remove ic folks oops I see you can remove it, maybe not.

604
01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:42.240
INSTRUCTOR: Unless going on yeah, I think, and I put this fixed stuff here, so you can remove ic.

605
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:46.170
INSTRUCTOR: And you should just issue still run right.

606
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.070
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so anyway.

607
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.670
INSTRUCTOR: i'll see y'all at 1010 so okay.

608
01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:50.910
INSTRUCTOR: DEMO.

609
01:31:56.730 --> 01:31:57.540
INSTRUCTOR: This.

610
01:31:58.710 --> 01:31:59.190
INSTRUCTOR: DEMO.

611
01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:00.990
INSTRUCTOR: scene.

612
01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:53.910
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so i'm going to start with DEMO.

613
01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:46.620
STUDENT 10: hi can everyone hear me.

614
01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:48.660
Okay.

615
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:04.980
STUDENT 10: Okay.

616
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:22.050
STUDENT 10: Alright, so the function of your sharing is called number and the syntax oral numbering could skip over partition by an order by.

617
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:35.070
STUDENT 10: So basically this function returns this equation number of a row, starting at one and when the data is petition the raw numbers reset to one when petition changes.

618
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:49.650
STUDENT 10: They share some basic excel see how this works for this girl number function, the other, the over and order by cause is required, but the petition by causes.

619
01:34:52.950 --> 01:35:02.790
STUDENT 10: So here's some of the usage for rule number one, why is it can be useful pagination, the other is.

620
01:35:04.170 --> 01:35:07.650
STUDENT 10: dating duplicating rose, except for one.

621
01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.440
STUDENT 10: So here's.

622
01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:19.170
STUDENT 10: One example, with only order by being used where the position by it's optional.

623
01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:24.840
STUDENT 10: Okay, so.

624
01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:41.340
STUDENT 10: So first up, I was choosing the cause, we want, in this case I choose and cat and dog, and then we will keep the same text for rule number so.

625
01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:57.240
STUDENT 10: There will use the order by choosing which column, we want the numbering with respect to so without position the numbering appears Gregory numbering a ranking starting from the inkjet.

626
01:35:58.290 --> 01:36:13.200
STUDENT 10: Starting from one, so the order numbers starts from one all the way to the total number of rows which is 775 ever the anchor value was our lowest value, all the way to the highest.

627
01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:36.390
STUDENT 10: So the next part is adding on petition by So when I include petition by the numbering will restart from one and when the value contained of the chosen column has changed in this case when Kevin changes from wanted to the order numbers restarts on one.

628
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:46.290
STUDENT 10: So can see from a risk, where where and cat changes phone wanted to the order number recounts.

629
01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:54.870
STUDENT 10: It sort of extra one, so it goes for the same way and get better changes, one of our country from tree to tree.

630
01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:58.530
STUDENT 10: He can be applied to text to.

631
01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:15.360
STUDENT 10: Okay, so here's an example for pagination I did so, the first step, I did I create a burly table using least ask operator.

632
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.480
STUDENT 10: And after that I.

633
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:37.080
STUDENT 10: selected the calls, based on the temporary table that I did pagination by using between an operator to split up the tables, so I can see that the table is being split up using the order number.

634
01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:46.710
STUDENT 10: So this this can be useful for some engineering purpose for just socializing the table.

635
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:48.660
STUDENT 10: Thanks.

636
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:56.070
INSTRUCTOR: Oh, thank you very much, I think it can be useful.

637
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:00.750
INSTRUCTOR: Although I use.

638
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.890
INSTRUCTOR: Like like i'm bringing.

639
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:14.940
INSTRUCTOR: This auto increment kind of thing, but I can imagine that for some cases, you can very useful.

640
01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.630
INSTRUCTOR: I think it'd be in.

641
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:27.840
INSTRUCTOR: The research is less used but add to our production and stuff they can be used quite a bit.

642
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:32.580
INSTRUCTOR: And you can.

643
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:36.150
INSTRUCTOR: continue where we left off.

644
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:20.040
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

645
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.360
INSTRUCTOR: yeah do you ask the question again.

646
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:30.720
INSTRUCTOR: I don't fully understand the question I appreciate you asking.

647
01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:33.540
INSTRUCTOR: Oh yeah.

648
01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:47.550
STUDENT 11: I can do you okay i'm trying to get as a can you hear me.

649
01:39:48.210 --> 01:39:58.860
STUDENT 11: yeah Okay, I can find it as a business analyst because I use a lot of data so someone can do the job okay let's say now, we assume that.

650
01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:11.280
STUDENT 11: We got more columns instead of two columns so let's say, for example, I I see mean the balance in both bang say psp on the DS DS in Paris company.

651
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:22.290
STUDENT 11: And also, he or whatever, so now i'm trying to tell you is that, first of all, for the same name, and I see will be a unique identity.

652
01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:31.320
STUDENT 11: So, when you say, let alone, let john wait until the fear for your skin color is understood that that your left your left side, and I see.

653
01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:51.570
STUDENT 11: But listen now I have more column name, and I see is identical you see if the unit, so how can you address this outer life comparison before you say you consolidate the same thing with the same it then to present in the band and.

654
01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:53.610
STUDENT 11: A tip and dbs yeah.

655
01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:57.630
INSTRUCTOR: yeah yeah so so let me thanks thanks Jeff.

656
01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.370
INSTRUCTOR: Sorry, no, no, no.

657
01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:00.090
STUDENT 11: No questions.

658
01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:02.640
INSTRUCTOR: No okay so yeah so.

659
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:11.250
INSTRUCTOR: Let me try to address this up so so left out to join right so left refers to table.

660
01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:22.800
INSTRUCTOR: Left table what color so so in the outer join whether or not is left or right because there's a there's another good one for right.

661
01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:32.610
INSTRUCTOR: For left, we are saying that the Left table it means the whole table is your is the base Okay, so this way you're starting point.

662
01:41:33.090 --> 01:41:49.170
INSTRUCTOR: And all the information in the Left table will survive in the results, the book that means when you are when you create a result stable everything that you have to lift a book is accessible to you, you can use any in any piece of information in the left a boat.

663
01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:52.530
INSTRUCTOR: In the original left a bow in your results stable.

664
01:41:54.060 --> 01:42:08.310
INSTRUCTOR: So if there are many, many columns here in the Left table I under select line when I specify the columns that went to appear my results table I can select any of them, and they will all show up as they are yeah.

665
01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:12.270
INSTRUCTOR: So the right table.

666
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:23.370
INSTRUCTOR: will join Rosa right cable will be tacked to specific rules in the depth table based on this joining condition.

667
01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:33.720
INSTRUCTOR: So in this case, all we needed was icy number, because we don't see them as a unique let's say if it were something else, like, I think.

668
01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:49.980
INSTRUCTOR: What Jeff alluded to it let's say you have more than one column that needs to match before you allow the rules across the tables to match, then you can just specify them here, you can see, I see number and another.

669
01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:59.640
INSTRUCTOR: Another thing say the name law, because I know it should be deceived by my this i'm just giving an example of.

670
01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.180
INSTRUCTOR: specify multiple.

671
01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:16.590
INSTRUCTOR: Conditions, you know for the adjoining condition okay just logical enter yeah so, then the only ones that show up to the if the ice numbers match and the names match.

672
01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.230
INSTRUCTOR: If they don't, then it would.

673
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:26.250
STUDENT 11: Show me this is my original discussion yeah anything different in particular will not be so.

674
01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:33.630
STUDENT 11: Good so perfect that could be some areas human error, I mean it can be seen Sydney, but I see.

675
01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:50.790
STUDENT 11: I see number different you see Oh, I see nothing but an indifferent so often, they want to be more deeper part decide on the Dell or the but what i'm trying to say on your left column is your feedback how you justify the next table is to be touching the left, you can rsvp.

676
01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.770
INSTRUCTOR: yeah you can but.

677
01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.670
INSTRUCTOR: There is also different so never.

678
01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.900
STUDENT 11: In a letter to join.

679
01:43:58.170 --> 01:43:59.220
INSTRUCTOR: The less stable.

680
01:43:59.310 --> 01:44:07.230
INSTRUCTOR: What whichever table you want is the one day, that is your base then you're right table is you are selectively.

681
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:16.530
INSTRUCTOR: Men your base with information for the right table based based on on this role conditioner.

682
01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:26.670
INSTRUCTOR: So everything in your left emo will be available to you, so you know if I do our hitch be left out the join.

683
01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:28.590
INSTRUCTOR: USB.

684
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:33.930
INSTRUCTOR: Let me remove this fictitious thing Michelle will not make sense right.

685
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:45.390
INSTRUCTOR: So now everything in my right in my left a bowl which is orange be shows up in my results right so Irish vs training Rosa of information, then see all three rocio.

686
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:48.330
INSTRUCTOR: That in.

687
01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:59.850
INSTRUCTOR: Late, so why not the rules in our HP there's no pause bank account so there's No amount for Postbank here.

688
01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.430
INSTRUCTOR: In the media meds.

689
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:04.530
INSTRUCTOR: Are HP.

690
01:45:06.330 --> 01:45:15.630
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so and I removed the ic number I just now so just not had posted bang and R ic.

691
01:45:17.970 --> 01:45:32.280
INSTRUCTOR: notice that the nri see right is now here for the the rule of rfp that has no corresponding amount because i'm seeing that pull the NRA see from the Postbank people.

692
01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:43.650
INSTRUCTOR: In this case, because there's no matching rule so nothing gets pulled So if I sit for the ice from the our hitch beatable then you'll see sure.

693
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:49.680
INSTRUCTOR: Because, in this case Irish be is the Left table.

694
01:45:50.700 --> 01:46:05.640
INSTRUCTOR: right because we see Irish Irish be left out the joining posting so that's the Left table and the right table the Left tables, the one to the left of the left of the drawing keywords and the right people is the one to the right or the left or the right keywords.

695
01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:09.150
STUDENT 11: and listen.

696
01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:20.250
STUDENT 11: and listen, I have another practical experience right for the Milan, we don't put the banking industry, it really is a type of food so.

697
01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:39.840
STUDENT 11: The same product darling So when I saw many custom will be in different food that range for that one for that for that so different under this tree top for that there are many customers that have revenue given me they have buy our products, so now on the mush the customer.

698
01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:51.960
STUDENT 11: To think on my bike to also put up to up to them faster than coming by by one, so how to how am I going to Peter singer from from two different table and Matthew using the author john.

699
01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:57.360
STUDENT 11: It can be.

700
01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.840
STUDENT 11: Just one by one or production.

701
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.670
STUDENT 11: By or the truth, without so I wanted much in the one similarity but to see.

702
01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:15.210
STUDENT 11: Who, I will be mikey day make yourself the minutes of the Buddha so well i'm kind of a mess you using the answer so.

703
01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:25.230
INSTRUCTOR: There are a few ways to do that, you can also do you can use outer join if you have a master list of all your customers is an ID or some unit right, then, that can be.

704
01:47:25.710 --> 01:47:28.590
STUDENT 11: That will be doing differently, but maybe for that one as.

705
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:30.180
STUDENT 11: well.

706
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.850
INSTRUCTOR: So what you can do right is this select distinct.

707
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.480
INSTRUCTOR: Right now, when I select this example, so you can do it select distinct.

708
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:57.630
INSTRUCTOR: yeah they meet you for jack so there's some noise right back on, so what you can do is you can select this thing from one customer this so distinct ID Union all.

709
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:13.860
INSTRUCTOR: You know our Union select distinct from the next one unions like distinct from that one and that will create a master list of all the unique ids or the new Judy customers, then use that as a base and he can live out the drain the different tables, I mean that's when we laugh.

710
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.110
INSTRUCTOR: So I hope yeah.

711
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:22.440
STUDENT 11: there's nothing that I need to Union.

712
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:29.190
INSTRUCTOR: They can get into all your so yeah so you can get in all the tables are.

713
01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:29.880
Okay.

714
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:32.010
INSTRUCTOR: But you only.

715
01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:33.420
INSTRUCTOR: The only thing that you're interested.

716
01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:37.140
INSTRUCTOR: In each table is just the customer name or the customer.

717
01:48:38.490 --> 01:48:39.000
STUDENT 11: ID yeah.

718
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:40.260
INSTRUCTOR: yeah.

719
01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:50.760
STUDENT 11: So let me i'll say testimony So if I compare the customer screen if it's the same, then I will result in present in one room.

720
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.740
INSTRUCTOR: yeah yeah.

721
01:48:54.930 --> 01:48:58.110
INSTRUCTOR: So so yeah I tried to do it myself apparently.

722
01:48:58.740 --> 01:48:59.430
STUDENT 11: I said to you.

723
01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:00.720
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, very good.

724
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:02.790
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, thank you, thanks good questions, thank you.

725
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.090
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, any other questions.

726
01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.770
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, though, then we have.

727
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:20.520
INSTRUCTOR: right out to join just don't get left out the joint never right on the drain, so instead of flipping.

728
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.020
INSTRUCTOR: The tables.

729
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:49.500
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so so flipping the tables around we can just see right and then now the right table is the base and then the Left table you take on information from the Left table where the condition is true.

730
01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:00.870
INSTRUCTOR: So.

731
01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:15.120
STUDENT 07: prophesied again as a question justin as soon as Jeff I just you giving one example that having a short we study, so if let's say I have a base report, just like the pure SP they have pure sb among.

732
01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:26.160
STUDENT 07: there's the same report has a base, then, that the report, which is that I should be so usually it will be look up to look at our the amount for the best report.

733
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:36.750
STUDENT 07: So my supposed to treat one I have been impure has been a mom and I SDM on by the one to use the ISP a mom I need to use the ISP Mr for the second report.

734
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:41.700
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

735
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:49.680
INSTRUCTOR: So you say I send you 212 columns that you want to replace one or the other, is it.

736
01:50:50.400 --> 01:51:04.920
STUDENT 07: doesn't last in my bedroom or is it still always clean, so I need to point out a report to file the lesson is the bottom two so in the psp amount up USD data, the first to my habit among second.

737
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:14.190
STUDENT 07: Bottom to might not have the amar wishes, I need to get from another report, but then I repeat my has for for amount by the ones of us to a mom.

738
01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:18.330
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

739
01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:25.410
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so we Okay, so let me do this.

740
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:32.910
INSTRUCTOR: Let me just create a new column, so we have.

741
01:51:35.190 --> 01:51:38.220
INSTRUCTOR: Right now, we have three columns right so.

742
01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:44.400
INSTRUCTOR: let's create a fourth column so.

743
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:10.590
INSTRUCTOR: shouldn't do that.

744
01:52:56.190 --> 01:52:58.470
INSTRUCTOR: So is this close to what you want.

745
01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:00.300
INSTRUCTOR: So essentially.

746
01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:01.770
STUDENT 07: thing is.

747
01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:11.670
INSTRUCTOR: If this like this column is not now I mean there's no missing I do, then this is the correct this column from this table if it's.

748
01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.940
INSTRUCTOR: If not now, then we use that information, otherwise we use the previous one.

749
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.350
Oh yeah.

750
01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.050
STUDENT 07: Okay, thank you.

751
01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:26.130
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so this is an example of the case structure.

752
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:39.030
INSTRUCTOR: So case when some condition being true, it is true, then you return this value, otherwise you return some other value.

753
01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:51.930
INSTRUCTOR: And then, so when you have a case when you must end it with the end and then this whole thing just returned to one value for Israel, and then we give it a column nima.

754
01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:00.000
STUDENT 07: Thank you.

755
01:54:00.810 --> 01:54:01.260
Okay.

756
01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:07.920
INSTRUCTOR: Questions everyone else anyone else.

757
01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:14.160
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

758
01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.260
INSTRUCTOR: So if you have questions, please jump in and just us yeah.

759
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:22.560
INSTRUCTOR: So.

760
01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:24.990
INSTRUCTOR: aggregate functions.

761
01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:33.300
INSTRUCTOR: There are many, many functions, so I I this just the common ones here so that you have.

762
01:54:34.050 --> 01:54:44.430
INSTRUCTOR: Some familiarity with them, so, but you know you check the full documentation to see whether or not there's an aggregate function for whatever you need you know if if there is then great you know they can just use it.

763
01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.700
INSTRUCTOR: If not, then you need to create one.

764
01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.910
INSTRUCTOR: which may or may not be easy.

765
01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.270
INSTRUCTOR: So, but most the time you can get away with using the standard aggregate functions.

766
01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:00.180
INSTRUCTOR: and doing a bit of acrobatics now.

767
01:55:01.890 --> 01:55:09.000
INSTRUCTOR: so rich, you know so within the group of rules that define your group, you know you compute the average.

768
01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:15.330
INSTRUCTOR: You have it could be a column or could be, you know.

769
01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:18.750
INSTRUCTOR: function of a column things in it.

770
01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.920
INSTRUCTOR: returns, the number of rows.

771
01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:33.720
INSTRUCTOR: If you do yeah see you then I can Okay, so we have this table right, so we know what this table looks like.

772
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:50.820
INSTRUCTOR: So.

773
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:57.000
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so let's try a few variants of count.

774
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:11.460
INSTRUCTOR: The simplest one is count star star is actually a special version of count.

775
01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:22.620
INSTRUCTOR: That is very, very fast, so if you are working with data sets with millions or 10s of millions of rows and stuff a day count star.

776
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:43.320
INSTRUCTOR: And you just want to know how many rooms, they are per group per whatever count star is why you don't do anything else Okay, so if you don't specify if you don't define what a group is the engine assumes that the entire table is a group so in this case, our entire table is this.

777
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:47.730
INSTRUCTOR: This table of essentially for.

778
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:50.820
INSTRUCTOR: Four rows okay.

779
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:56.910
INSTRUCTOR: Let me just take a picture of this and then.

780
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:07.140
INSTRUCTOR: Everyone can see.

781
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:26.940
INSTRUCTOR: Is our, I just wanted to make sure that we all know what the the table looks like so this temp table looks like this.

782
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:29.670
INSTRUCTOR: So I do count stuff.

783
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:35.010
INSTRUCTOR: yeah just keep me for okay right so far rose right.

784
01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:43.050
INSTRUCTOR: What if I do count our hit should be amongst what happens.

785
01:57:46.770 --> 01:57:47.820
INSTRUCTOR: What do you think what we said.

786
01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:52.290
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, true.

787
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:57.810
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so when you count a column name.

788
01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:07.350
INSTRUCTOR: Like a column what you're doing is you're counting the number of non now values in the column.

789
01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:09.750
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

790
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.560
INSTRUCTOR: which is different from counting the number of rules in that group.

791
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:21.660
INSTRUCTOR: Right, so now, a company number number non now values for the column in the group, as opposed to just number of rules in a group.

792
01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.320
INSTRUCTOR: So if I choose a column where there's no now let's see.

793
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.080
INSTRUCTOR: posting about.

794
01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:33.180
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

795
01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:43.170
INSTRUCTOR: Then they are for non now values in this column for this group, the whole table in this case so then it's just for.

796
01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.480
INSTRUCTOR: So Questions about this.

797
01:58:57.870 --> 01:59:01.110
INSTRUCTOR: Let me, let me change this a little bit now.

798
01:59:02.190 --> 01:59:03.660
INSTRUCTOR: So let's see.

799
01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.470
INSTRUCTOR: Yes.

800
01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.160
INSTRUCTOR: So it rose right.

801
01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:28.920
INSTRUCTOR: To this.

802
01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:58.110
INSTRUCTOR: This.

803
02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:18.030
INSTRUCTOR: So now we have this table right, so this is our.

804
02:00:19.050 --> 02:00:19.980
INSTRUCTOR: Results table.

805
02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:23.340
INSTRUCTOR: So first question.

806
02:00:26.610 --> 02:00:27.510
INSTRUCTOR: What does this free thing.

807
02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:32.220
INSTRUCTOR: That comes.

808
02:00:33.690 --> 02:00:35.700
INSTRUCTOR: From this this table.

809
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.530
INSTRUCTOR: But the other thing he returns.

810
02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:59.400
INSTRUCTOR: So almost everyone says it, I think I saw the name, I think, maybe this content.

811
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.940
INSTRUCTOR: It okay.

812
02:01:11.010 --> 02:01:13.110
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, how about counting ric.

813
02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:18.900
INSTRUCTOR: What does this return it.

814
02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.620
INSTRUCTOR: How distinct and R ic what does this return.

815
02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:35.280
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

816
02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:47.670
INSTRUCTOR: So So you see the different ways use counts right so counts column name counting distinct column name yeah.

817
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:58.950
INSTRUCTOR: If you specify more than one column name, you can then it looks for look at the whole combination and accountant distinct versions of it okay.

818
02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:08.610
INSTRUCTOR: So good content.

819
02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:12.750
INSTRUCTOR: Good content it's fun so.

820
02:02:15.450 --> 02:02:16.830
INSTRUCTOR: You something.

821
02:02:23.190 --> 02:02:29.100
INSTRUCTOR: This 3000 rows so let's see we won and.

822
02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:34.950
lost.

823
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:10.020
INSTRUCTOR: So.

824
02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:12.480
INSTRUCTOR: let's see.

825
02:03:14.490 --> 02:03:16.080
INSTRUCTOR: let's avoid.

826
02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:26.730
INSTRUCTOR: i'm just doing this, so that the results table doesn't look too crazy law and scripted and.

827
02:03:27.930 --> 02:03:28.440
form.

828
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:42.930
INSTRUCTOR: So we can do something called group on campus easier to show them to experience.

829
02:03:48.630 --> 02:03:49.500
INSTRUCTOR: Forget what's.

830
02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:19.440
INSTRUCTOR: What group does is that for each group, it will concatenate means no string together.

831
02:04:21.450 --> 02:04:22.830
INSTRUCTOR: In one line.

832
02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:27.150
INSTRUCTOR: The values of whichever column yeah.

833
02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:01.260
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

834
02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:05.850
INSTRUCTOR: Any questions about group content.

835
02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:18.330
INSTRUCTOR: If not, then.

836
02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.590
INSTRUCTOR: Let me try to address this.

837
02:05:22.590 --> 02:05:24.000
STUDENT 11: question I.

838
02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:24.840
INSTRUCTOR: Oh yes, yes.

839
02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:32.640
STUDENT 11: To be like something that we tend to dream right TIM certain.

840
02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.720
STUDENT 11: something and then it's easy, this is a mini.

841
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:37.860
INSTRUCTOR: No, no, no.

842
02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:38.700
INSTRUCTOR: So.

843
02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:40.080
INSTRUCTOR: This is good content right.

844
02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:42.690
INSTRUCTOR: You say she just depends.

845
02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:48.390
INSTRUCTOR: All the values together into one into one string.

846
02:05:49.530 --> 02:05:59.640
INSTRUCTOR: So, by default, uses commerce to separate the values from each other so because, for each of these groups, you have a different number of households.

847
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:08.940
INSTRUCTOR: So there are six households that have five cats and then these are the household ID for those six households, there are five households that six kids.

848
02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:11.460
INSTRUCTOR: And these are the five house or ideas for those houses.

849
02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.590
INSTRUCTOR: there's only one house oh seven kits for this.

850
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:14.880
INSTRUCTOR: one.

851
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:21.810
INSTRUCTOR: And then they'll need to outsource it gets in every parts to it obviously separates the values of a comma.

852
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:23.220
Oh.

853
02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:24.990
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

854
02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:30.690
INSTRUCTOR: He said to concatenate and create the line.

855
02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:36.420
INSTRUCTOR: Well, this is the first time i've asked this question.

856
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:40.050
STUDENT 07: I just a specific today's.

857
02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:47.430
STUDENT 07: been a few in the phone so they educate the sku in one string this comic comic con me.

858
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:52.350
STUDENT 07: Where we need to analyze business skill right, we need to break down to 69 cents for.

859
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:53.280
STUDENT 07: Each of the common.

860
02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:59.370
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so my My answer is are using language.

861
02:07:00.690 --> 02:07:00.960
STUDENT 07: Okay.

862
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:07.470
INSTRUCTOR: Nothing it's not it's not possible it's just i've never done it before about media is possible.

863
02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:15.630
INSTRUCTOR: it's easy to do in in other languages that so there's obviously a split function in other languages.

864
02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:25.110
INSTRUCTOR: string splitting equivalent yeah yeah yeah, so we will talk about it in the costs but yes good question and very interesting casino, and you think about it, thank you.

865
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:26.310
STUDENT 07: Thank you.

866
02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:28.860
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

867
02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:29.550
So.

868
02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:31.920
INSTRUCTOR: Let me.

869
02:07:33.330 --> 02:07:34.080
INSTRUCTOR: Where was it.

870
02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:36.240
INSTRUCTOR: one.

871
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:43.710
INSTRUCTOR: This one Okay, so we had this table.

872
02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.630
INSTRUCTOR: This table.

873
02:07:50.190 --> 02:07:52.920
INSTRUCTOR: which was this this.

874
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:57.720
INSTRUCTOR: Right, I think this is the correct the boy.

875
02:07:58.890 --> 02:08:01.350
INSTRUCTOR: I hope this table yeah I think so.

876
02:08:02.670 --> 02:08:04.350
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so if.

877
02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:06.810
INSTRUCTOR: I go.

878
02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:10.410
INSTRUCTOR: amount it should be too right.

879
02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:16.980
INSTRUCTOR: So I think there's a question in the chat about if you want to report many different versions of this.

880
02:08:26.490 --> 02:08:32.550
INSTRUCTOR: Then you can just specify them as different columns on the same, I mean the same query.

881
02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.400
INSTRUCTOR: called star.

882
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.610
Okay.

883
02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:47.880
INSTRUCTOR: All right.

884
02:08:50.400 --> 02:09:00.660
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so maximum minimum values within the group standard deviation some variants yeah so very difficult things.

885
02:09:01.890 --> 02:09:08.490
INSTRUCTOR: There is something missing from sql that is usually found in most.

886
02:09:10.110 --> 02:09:14.580
INSTRUCTOR: programming languages that give you some statistics so which is median.

887
02:09:15.870 --> 02:09:21.180
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, median Thank you James so median is missing from seo okay.

888
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:31.560
INSTRUCTOR: You can create one function to do media in sql if you really wanted to but generally people just don't bother.

889
02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:39.540
INSTRUCTOR: you're just reading the data into our or Python or something and then just use the built in media and function within our or Python.

890
02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:48.870
INSTRUCTOR: Because you know that you know that has been checked and will work in all cases right if you create and medium function, there could be some special case some.

891
02:09:51.690 --> 02:09:56.760
INSTRUCTOR: anomalous cases that your function returns something ridiculous right.

892
02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:03.330
INSTRUCTOR: So it's obviously for to use the built in functions and not Korea or if if possible yeah.

893
02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:10.140
INSTRUCTOR: So always read the documentation Google, you know try find out has this already been written right is this part of the language is it.

894
02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:24.450
INSTRUCTOR: package that you need to install right, and then you can make use off as opposed to spending the time to build it from scratch and it's not a simple function that you need to test your many different cases, you should if it's.

895
02:10:26.130 --> 02:10:31.200
INSTRUCTOR: Do something sensible, you know in right so.

896
02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:32.820
Okay.

897
02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:39.000
INSTRUCTOR: So I think I have an example about how to use it average yeah.

898
02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:53.370
INSTRUCTOR: So let me go through this example because I think it's different be slightly different from what you see Okay, so this example.

899
02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.330
INSTRUCTOR: So this is.

900
02:10:58.830 --> 02:11:00.270
INSTRUCTOR: yeah let me do this.

901
02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:20.910
INSTRUCTOR: From previous.

902
02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:27.810
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

903
02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:44.370
INSTRUCTOR: First of all, notice that this is not a bad column by an expression using values in a column yeah so i'm doing a comparison between each value.

904
02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:50.520
INSTRUCTOR: Each value appellants i'm comparing it to 250,000.

905
02:11:51.630 --> 02:11:55.470
INSTRUCTOR: If it exceeds 250,000 then it's true.

906
02:11:56.700 --> 02:12:03.150
INSTRUCTOR: logical true so if something is true is expressed as a one in the German.

907
02:12:04.170 --> 02:12:14.220
INSTRUCTOR: If it doesn't exceed 250,000 is less than or equal to 30,000 it's false and logical false is expresses zero yeah.

908
02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:23.100
INSTRUCTOR: So I now have a column of ones and zeros and then information associated with each of these.

909
02:12:24.210 --> 02:12:25.650
INSTRUCTOR: So what can I do with this.

910
02:12:28.530 --> 02:12:29.160
INSTRUCTOR: So.

911
02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:31.020
INSTRUCTOR: I can.

912
02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:36.870
INSTRUCTOR: I can group by.

913
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:42.750
INSTRUCTOR: column, I like this column ones and zeros.

914
02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:50.490
INSTRUCTOR: So remember a group is defined as a unique value of the of the grouping column.

915
02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.400
INSTRUCTOR: So.

916
02:12:54.420 --> 02:13:07.710
INSTRUCTOR: All rules that share the same value of the grouping column belong in the same group so in this case, the first and fourth row will be powerful group Middleton was be part of another group.

917
02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.920
INSTRUCTOR: So what do I report for each group.

918
02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.840
INSTRUCTOR: This case I report average balance.

919
02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:33.240
INSTRUCTOR: So, and what it does, is it takes the average of each of them, so I can do some balance so sm together right, I can do men balance.

920
02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:35.910
INSTRUCTOR: Is the minimum value.

921
02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:43.770
INSTRUCTOR: Similarly Max balance right, so I can reap all this, I can also do this, our other.

922
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:46.410
INSTRUCTOR: function.

923
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:56.460
INSTRUCTOR: If I want to keep track of ice numbers and I just chuck them all together in one in one field somewhere.

924
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:11.040
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so so once again notice i'm using a shortcut I say goodbye, one that means the first column on my select line that's my grouping column.

925
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:33.210
INSTRUCTOR: digest and then questions asked questions.

926
02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:09.390
STUDENT 07: see changed from dbs to people when I see.

927
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:13.500
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

928
02:15:15.570 --> 02:15:25.410
INSTRUCTOR: Because we're asking we're doing comparison operation right, so we had me, and then we bought the goodbye.

929
02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:57.930
INSTRUCTOR: Oh, so we have balance and I see from the dbs table right, so any we have another column that says is asked the question is balance greater than 250 K.

930
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:06.060
INSTRUCTOR: So it is true, then sql will be part one for the room if it's false a report zero So you see.

931
02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:26.310
INSTRUCTOR: So we are, we are creating a new column on the fly based on data from an existing column in this case that balance column So you see the balance color for this role 430 K is created 250 so come to one says 22 K will be zero at 4k 03 hundred K away.

932
02:16:28.230 --> 02:16:29.850
INSTRUCTOR: that's how you create della okay.

933
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:30.750
INSTRUCTOR: Great.

934
02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.970
STUDENT 07: So I think Russia from Rebecca to see where they can return to true for Cisco.

935
02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:36.510
Yes.

936
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:38.880
INSTRUCTOR: So.

937
02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.020
kiss.

938
02:16:42.810 --> 02:16:43.680
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

939
02:16:44.850 --> 02:16:48.360
INSTRUCTOR: We can do the same version of keys wishes case when.

940
02:16:50.250 --> 02:16:52.230
INSTRUCTOR: yeah then.

941
02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:56.700
INSTRUCTOR: So case when balance is greater than you say true.

942
02:16:59.190 --> 02:17:02.640
INSTRUCTOR: False and S.

943
02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:04.830
INSTRUCTOR: Hypo.

944
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:16.740
INSTRUCTOR: So what is that we say true false who could be could change this to see Hypo.

945
02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:20.220
INSTRUCTOR: Regular.

946
02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:22.470
s.

947
02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:24.090
segment.

948
02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:29.070
INSTRUCTOR: So you can just specify anything you whether.

949
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:37.050
STUDENT 07: You ask the question is listed as well, and I see the balance to empty let's do a test you.

950
02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:42.240
INSTRUCTOR: It is it what i've done is if.

951
02:17:43.650 --> 02:17:47.550
STUDENT 07: I say that one seven a string I see.

952
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.480
Okay.

953
02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.180
INSTRUCTOR: let's let's try to.

954
02:17:58.350 --> 02:18:02.310
INSTRUCTOR: PBS to okay so.

955
02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:09.330
INSTRUCTOR: DPS DPS to.

956
02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:13.740
INSTRUCTOR: That.

957
02:18:16.590 --> 02:18:17.340
INSTRUCTOR: Because.

958
02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:19.050
INSTRUCTOR: Now.

959
02:18:40.710 --> 02:18:41.940
INSTRUCTOR: What did I do wrong.

960
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.230
INSTRUCTOR: What did I do wrong.

961
02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:54.630
INSTRUCTOR: zero is a problem here, no it's not a problem here.

962
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:03.780
INSTRUCTOR: The table, no, no.

963
02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:09.900
INSTRUCTOR: Oh sorry.

964
02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:11.880
INSTRUCTOR: Where.

965
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.560
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

966
02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:15.480
INSTRUCTOR: sorry about that.

967
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:21.780
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so now what i'm going to know right.

968
02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:24.990
INSTRUCTOR: So, and then.

969
02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:31.170
INSTRUCTOR: Some thing.

970
02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.120
yeah.

971
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.230
INSTRUCTOR: Oh sorry.

972
02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:55.980
INSTRUCTOR: Ladies, I guess, it is now, then.

973
02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:58.230
INSTRUCTOR: It cannot compute.

974
02:19:59.430 --> 02:20:05.730
INSTRUCTOR: You cannot compute the weather is greater than the comparison operator right.

975
02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:18.360
STUDENT 07: So in this case, we can just put a condition when network is good there then poof I can, if I care.

976
02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.690
STUDENT 07: And blame.

977
02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:30.330
INSTRUCTOR: Okay okay so so you want it robust for knowledge right so.

978
02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:42.240
INSTRUCTOR: Maybe.

979
02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:48.900
INSTRUCTOR: it's not now is no.

980
02:20:51.930 --> 02:20:58.440
INSTRUCTOR: Yun in London, now the boat with Hypo or not not not not people that I bought.

981
02:20:59.550 --> 02:21:03.270
STUDENT 07: should be sauce which is not graded and provide to do.

982
02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:11.040
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

983
02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:17.850
INSTRUCTOR: Sorry, so the now people you want this to be 01.

984
02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:22.260
INSTRUCTOR: Do zero so now be zero.

985
02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:25.380
Okay.

986
02:21:27.900 --> 02:21:30.810
INSTRUCTOR: So we can do this.

987
02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:34.260
INSTRUCTOR: Then one.

988
02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:36.390
INSTRUCTOR: When.

989
02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:37.980
INSTRUCTOR: Net.

990
02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:41.160
INSTRUCTOR: is now.

991
02:21:43.770 --> 02:21:46.680
INSTRUCTOR: Zero l zero and.

992
02:21:58.020 --> 02:22:02.850
INSTRUCTOR: So that's a little bit easier to see.

993
02:22:04.530 --> 02:22:05.280
INSTRUCTOR: So.

994
02:22:21.810 --> 02:22:37.710
INSTRUCTOR: So this whole thing is one column law, so we are defining our X X PR column, you know with this case structure, so the first condition is or the first thing we check is where they're not net worth is created in 2000 it is and why i'm.

995
02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:47.880
INSTRUCTOR: Sharing check is whether or not is now is now let me see zero otherwise in all the cases vc zero.

996
02:22:51.210 --> 02:22:53.970
INSTRUCTOR: And every end the key structure and every give it a name.

997
02:22:59.250 --> 02:22:59.730
STUDENT 07: Thank you.

998
02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.410
INSTRUCTOR: Oh, the dbs to table actually is a duplicate of the dds table.

999
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:25.830
INSTRUCTOR: So you could everything I did show you could just do with the dbs table yeah.

1000
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:43.650
INSTRUCTOR: So yeah so how I created this table was I said, create table dbs true, and then I have the select query select Hannah.

1001
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:50.250
INSTRUCTOR: So selects.

1002
02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:12.900
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so I use this I use this just to create the dbs to table, so you have a create table.

1003
02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:22.890
INSTRUCTOR: In a table name that you are in front of the select query that you want, so instead of this, the results of this select query.

1004
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:35.640
INSTRUCTOR: appearing in the results table, you know, in your in your query window, you will be checked into a new table called dbs in this case yeah.

1005
02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.270
INSTRUCTOR: Any other questions about this.

1006
02:24:59.370 --> 02:25:00.510
INSTRUCTOR: OK, so now.

1007
02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:05.430
INSTRUCTOR: i'd like you to try to do this.

1008
02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:14.850
INSTRUCTOR: So from the sauce and it's called DEMO table that three columns.

1009
02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:29.400
INSTRUCTOR: That you should focus on above catch them adopt and an income right and it's a, so this is what they look like in terms of the structure the table structure so.

1010
02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:33.030
INSTRUCTOR: So try to answer this question.

1011
02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:09.240
INSTRUCTOR: If you haven't figured it out, please put some emoticon.

1012
02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:15.000
INSTRUCTOR: Heaven if you haven't figured it out, but if you have feedback.

1013
02:29:29.250 --> 02:29:29.820
INSTRUCTOR: People.

1014
02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:46.410
hey.

1015
02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:50.850
INSTRUCTOR: Can you didn't put a crying face okay.

1016
02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:56.520
INSTRUCTOR: So that's true so actually you can do another show yeah.

1017
02:29:59.010 --> 02:30:00.000
INSTRUCTOR: So what do we have.

1018
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:02.910
INSTRUCTOR: We have income.

1019
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:11.190
INSTRUCTOR: Right, so we have all this.

1020
02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:14.850
say.

1021
02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:20.910
INSTRUCTOR: So what you need what you want, if.

1022
02:30:21.930 --> 02:30:47.220
INSTRUCTOR: You want to define two groups right you want to partition your table into two two different subsets that are segments, so one segment people households that are below or equal to the average income bracket and another segment house was the above average income bracket right so.

1023
02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:57.660
INSTRUCTOR: What you need to know, essentially, besides the end Doc and K, is whether the income is greater than average income.

1024
02:30:59.490 --> 02:31:01.470
INSTRUCTOR: About we don't have everything come here.

1025
02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:04.590
INSTRUCTOR: Right So how do we do this.

1026
02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:19.260
INSTRUCTOR: So, if only we had an average income column in addition to our income and can end up column, then we could solve it right, so if we had if we had all this, we could solve it.

1027
02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:25.110
INSTRUCTOR: So how do we do this, so we say why don't we create the average income color.

1028
02:31:27.570 --> 02:31:29.340
INSTRUCTOR: So we asked.

1029
02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:42.150
INSTRUCTOR: If we do this gives us everything coming.

1030
02:31:51.390 --> 02:31:59.760
INSTRUCTOR: So we can create a new table that contains just a single value for everything come.

1031
02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:06.810
INSTRUCTOR: So, and we query from the stapler.

1032
02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:38.550
INSTRUCTOR: Right, we need data or do we need, we still need end CAP end up Enda income value for each row in our single source table right single source DEMO table so on our from line we select our table a only contains a single value call average income, and we also.

1033
02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.270
INSTRUCTOR: select from the single source DEMO tape low.

1034
02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:49.890
INSTRUCTOR: So in this specific case and in cases similar to this, you do not need.

1035
02:32:51.000 --> 02:33:03.450
INSTRUCTOR: To specify the relationship between rules in one table with rules in another table, because if you think about it, logically, the average income value.

1036
02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:06.660
INSTRUCTOR: should apply to all households.

1037
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:14.880
INSTRUCTOR: So it will just tag on average income as a new column, to the single source DEMO right.

1038
02:33:18.210 --> 02:33:18.960
INSTRUCTOR: Now.

1039
02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:25.260
INSTRUCTOR: We have.

1040
02:33:31.230 --> 02:33:31.920
INSTRUCTOR: Income.

1041
02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:37.560
INSTRUCTOR: created an average income, so this is our grouping.

1042
02:33:44.670 --> 02:33:46.500
INSTRUCTOR: So this defines our group.

1043
02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:57.150
INSTRUCTOR: It is created an average income, it will be one it is less than or equal to average income you'll be zero yeah.

1044
02:33:58.620 --> 02:34:07.650
INSTRUCTOR: And then, what do we want, we want to return the average number of cats and dogs.

1045
02:34:20.850 --> 02:34:21.450
INSTRUCTOR: y'all get it.

1046
02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:48.360
INSTRUCTOR: Let me.

1047
02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:56.640
INSTRUCTOR: just go roll back one step, just so that everyone knows what's happening.

1048
02:34:59.430 --> 02:35:03.210
INSTRUCTOR: So at this point where i'm pulling from two tables.

1049
02:35:04.890 --> 02:35:07.050
INSTRUCTOR: This is what it looks like.

1050
02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:09.750
INSTRUCTOR: So you have the original.

1051
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:14.670
INSTRUCTOR: single source DEMO table, and you have an average income call them.

1052
02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:23.970
INSTRUCTOR: back to the single source DEMO table, so this is 3189 rules there's a same number of rules as a single single source DEMO.

1053
02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:25.710
INSTRUCTOR: yeah.

1054
02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:35.640
INSTRUCTOR: Everyone understand why is the same number of rows.

1055
02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:48.180
INSTRUCTOR: So so because we have access to all this information.

1056
02:35:49.410 --> 02:35:52.110
INSTRUCTOR: Then we can just.

1057
02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:57.210
INSTRUCTOR: Ask the question whether or not income is created, and everything come.

1058
02:35:58.830 --> 02:36:00.600
INSTRUCTOR: Every fish and Cat and.

1059
02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:07.110
INSTRUCTOR: Then we could buy.

1060
02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:21.150
INSTRUCTOR: So average can be you can do a manual average by adding.

1061
02:36:25.650 --> 02:36:26.640
INSTRUCTOR: And dividing.

1062
02:37:17.610 --> 02:37:18.900
INSTRUCTOR: Any questions for this.

1063
02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:54.750
STUDENT 12: i'm sorry what is seo line from select any so I can see the end result as a in your table.

1064
02:37:56.310 --> 02:37:56.850
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

1065
02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.260
INSTRUCTOR: So when we are creating a table on the fly.

1066
02:38:03.690 --> 02:38:21.750
INSTRUCTOR: Because we're not creating it like explicitly creating a new table right so we're just doing this selected returns some values I put a bracket around it and I get treated as if this is a real table, but to treat it as is a real table on the from nine I need to give it a name.

1067
02:38:23.430 --> 02:38:29.070
INSTRUCTOR: So I put as a table ALA I can call it anything I want 10 la.

1068
02:38:30.090 --> 02:38:32.220
INSTRUCTOR: No it'll still work yeah.

1069
02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:43.350
INSTRUCTOR: Because like if the point of giving it a name sorry oops yeah the point of giving it a name is that when you refer to a column here.

1070
02:38:44.370 --> 02:38:45.180
INSTRUCTOR: I can see.

1071
02:38:46.260 --> 02:39:04.260
INSTRUCTOR: Irish income column from table in this case, because I call the table, so why is this necessary well because what is necessary if you're using the from line, but why is important, imagine, I created originally come in, I call the income.

1072
02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:14.010
INSTRUCTOR: Then now by table he has income column amazing so as demos income column right so now, I need to be very specific specific.

1073
02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:33.210
INSTRUCTOR: Is the same thing, because the data didn't change at this stage names yeah so so even this it is cumbersome if you keep referring to you don't keep typing single source DEMO out, you can give it a name.

1074
02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:38.280
STUDENT 12: But I would not be able to see the name of the whole table the E.

1075
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:40.200
INSTRUCTOR: mini the results, the bar.

1076
02:39:40.530 --> 02:39:44.550
INSTRUCTOR: yeah yeah it went up you just you know just show you just showed that.

1077
02:39:47.310 --> 02:39:52.140
INSTRUCTOR: yeah if I do the income here, you should just sit income.

1078
02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:55.770
INSTRUCTOR: Because I could I cannot just do a bit.

1079
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:59.670
INSTRUCTOR: Sorry, but yeah you'll just say income is.

1080
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:02.100
INSTRUCTOR: Just fun.

1081
02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:22.950
INSTRUCTOR: So, but the naming of the table is necessary if you do like in $90 like a like.

1082
02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:31.920
INSTRUCTOR: A nasty query and using the results of that query as this as if it's a table, so you need to give it a name if it's on the front line.

1083
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:34.140
STUDENT 12: Okay next.

1084
02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:34.560
Okay.

1085
02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:36.810
INSTRUCTOR: there's another way.

1086
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:37.680
INSTRUCTOR: To do this.

1087
02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:42.150
INSTRUCTOR: which I don't like but y'all can do if you want.

1088
02:40:43.350 --> 02:40:54.480
INSTRUCTOR: Because I don't like because I I don't understand I don't fully understand or appreciate it implications, when it comes to a huge data set again, so I show you so this thing here.

1089
02:40:55.530 --> 02:40:59.430
INSTRUCTOR: yeah this whole thing actually you don't need to be under from like.

1090
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:10.950
INSTRUCTOR: simplify this you don't need to do all this just answer the question.

1091
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:38.040
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so instead of computing this as an ester query and putting under from line I can do this in line here on the.

1092
02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:47.250
INSTRUCTOR: On the on the part of the select statement that deals with the columns right so i'm creating a column value on the go.

1093
02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:52.050
INSTRUCTOR: yeah so this also works.

1094
02:41:53.280 --> 02:42:02.520
INSTRUCTOR: So, but my what I have not figured out and why I avoid doing this is good, a do this for every role.

1095
02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:06.810
INSTRUCTOR: or do they do this one's in jenna.

1096
02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:16.950
INSTRUCTOR: For you know for the query it did it is for every rule, then my single source demos 3000 rows so they're doing they're executing this 3000 times.

1097
02:42:18.210 --> 02:42:23.220
INSTRUCTOR: Recently, and I put on the front line I know it gets executed only once yeah.

1098
02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:35.670
INSTRUCTOR: So so but I just want you all to know that this is possible, as well yeah and y'all can experiment, so if you have a.

1099
02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:42.720
INSTRUCTOR: If you have a database with millions of rows right, and then you do this at any time in and see how long it takes.

1100
02:42:43.050 --> 02:42:54.030
INSTRUCTOR: And whether or not it's any different from putting it on the from line, it is no different than let me know, and I know that it's also about it, I think all these years i'd be just putting at it from like okay so but yeah just.

1101
02:42:55.290 --> 02:42:59.220
INSTRUCTOR: good to know that these things are possible, and this is only possible because.

1102
02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:08.700
INSTRUCTOR: This whole thing returns, a single value yeah then it makes sense right.

1103
02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:34.260
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

1104
02:43:37.950 --> 02:43:39.030
INSTRUCTOR: more questions.

1105
02:43:51.690 --> 02:43:55.500
INSTRUCTOR: So a very good questions everyone, I think.

1106
02:43:57.210 --> 02:44:01.440
INSTRUCTOR: it's very useful to clarify anything that you are unsure about.

1107
02:44:08.430 --> 02:44:09.000
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

1108
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:11.040
INSTRUCTOR: I think.

1109
02:44:12.450 --> 02:44:13.350
INSTRUCTOR: we'll stop here.

1110
02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:15.570
INSTRUCTOR: Take a picture.

1111
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:38.820
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

1112
02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:45.990
INSTRUCTOR: You got your cameras on if you can turn on the cameras are just a few seconds, we can take a picture.

1113
02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:48.570
INSTRUCTOR: Okay huh.

1114
02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:02.280
INSTRUCTOR: A.

1115
02:45:03.300 --> 02:45:04.260
INSTRUCTOR: Few people.

1116
02:45:08.010 --> 02:45:12.390
INSTRUCTOR: going to count down from 10 of the y'all can turn on their cameras.

1117
02:45:17.010 --> 02:45:17.610
INSTRUCTOR: A.

1118
02:45:18.750 --> 02:45:22.050
INSTRUCTOR: 7654.

1119
02:45:23.970 --> 02:45:26.640
INSTRUCTOR: Okay smile for the camera.

1120
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:36.960
INSTRUCTOR: Okay try it one more time 123 style.

1121
02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:47.250
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, I think we are good okay.

1122
02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:52.230
INSTRUCTOR: So one question but to me how should we approach it.

1123
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:58.440
INSTRUCTOR: focus.

1124
02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:01.530
INSTRUCTOR: me read it.

1125
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:07.650
INSTRUCTOR: To me.

1126
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:24.210
INSTRUCTOR: So James asking about the CME.

1127
02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:03.810
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

1128
02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:07.980
INSTRUCTOR: A couple of things for the key me.

1129
02:47:16.290 --> 02:47:19.470
INSTRUCTOR: Make sure we referring to the same version that you're have.

1130
02:48:01.350 --> 02:48:02.700
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so.

1131
02:48:20.190 --> 02:48:21.570
INSTRUCTOR: Thanks.

1132
02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:47.880
INSTRUCTOR: So this is today's.

1133
02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:53.010
INSTRUCTOR: The end up to this deck right after this okay.

1134
02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:55.230
INSTRUCTOR: So there's a section.

1135
02:48:57.390 --> 02:49:01.560
INSTRUCTOR: On the different data types in my sql.

1136
02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:06.690
INSTRUCTOR: OK, so the values that they can take on.

1137
02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:15.900
INSTRUCTOR: reasons why use specific data types This is especially true for decimal.

1138
02:49:17.550 --> 02:49:19.710
INSTRUCTOR: yeah so.

1139
02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:26.310
INSTRUCTOR: In general, if you are talking about money, always use decimal.

1140
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:37.950
INSTRUCTOR: If you're not talking about money, but some real number than knowing can use double something else sort of something yeah doesn't matter.

1141
02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:56.670
INSTRUCTOR: So a bunch of things about pizza times all design, important to read and understand you don't have to memorize right, but you should at least understand and be exposed to when you use certain types of stuff now CHA CHA the difference, the differences between China and Russia.

1142
02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:07.560
INSTRUCTOR: Other other random stuff, which is important, you know if you intend to do this regularly outside the costs yeah.

1143
02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:15.090
INSTRUCTOR: The different two different ways music is operator, so today i've been using this one.

1144
02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:26.130
INSTRUCTOR: Is noticing the queue at case when and then a whole bunch of different conditions there's another one called case without the when.

1145
02:50:27.810 --> 02:50:32.160
INSTRUCTOR: So, and then this is either a column of expression that comes up with.

1146
02:50:33.210 --> 02:50:42.810
INSTRUCTOR: unique value to the column so then when, whatever the value is then you do something when why that is to something else so.

1147
02:50:44.250 --> 02:50:57.030
INSTRUCTOR: Essentially, this version works if it's only you're only looking at equivalents the when the value is equal to this, then you do something else, when the veil is equal to something else, maybe somebody else was.

1148
02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:05.550
INSTRUCTOR: The case when it's more flexible, because you can see when it's created in something is between a little barn up about you know any thoughts on.

1149
02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:08.670
INSTRUCTOR: logic.

1150
02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:16.470
INSTRUCTOR: Comparison or logical expression expression that will result in a true or false yeah, then you can use.

1151
02:51:17.670 --> 02:51:18.180
INSTRUCTOR: So.

1152
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.750
INSTRUCTOR: rollback.

1153
02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:26.850
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so there are a few questions in the tma.

1154
02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:32.940
INSTRUCTOR: One is trying to figure out what alter alter table does.

1155
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:45.150
INSTRUCTOR: And how to use it Okay, so if you Google for this, it should be very simple so that to me, is for me to get you all comfortable with passing true.

1156
02:51:46.410 --> 02:52:01.350
INSTRUCTOR: information is available on the Internet, when it comes to coding and making sense of it and then being able to use what you've you, you can clean off the Internet Okay, so the one is very simple alter table is a very simple command yeah.

1157
02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:21.750
INSTRUCTOR: So you look at the table that you're given and then that the data type all the columns and you consider the values that these columns take on and you ask yourself a question about whether or not these are optimal data types.

1158
02:52:23.010 --> 02:52:26.730
INSTRUCTOR: So, or can you get away with something.

1159
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:29.460
INSTRUCTOR: better or more appropriate.

1160
02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:33.150
INSTRUCTOR: Optimal and, in the sense of.

1161
02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:35.610
INSTRUCTOR: The space required.

1162
02:52:36.630 --> 02:52:39.690
INSTRUCTOR: So these are fairly small data sets.

1163
02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:55.110
INSTRUCTOR: Like data on you know if you do this more and more you'll be explosive huge data sets right that will you try to do things in a less efficient manner, take up a lot of space.

1164
02:52:56.130 --> 02:52:59.220
INSTRUCTOR: lot memory all the operations slow down.

1165
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:13.200
INSTRUCTOR: So the data that we're using in this course small enough that you can get away without having to create indices on their tables but later on, you know she also read up about in this season and how the speed of operations yeah.

1166
02:53:14.310 --> 02:53:16.230
INSTRUCTOR: So, but so.

1167
02:53:17.610 --> 02:53:25.710
INSTRUCTOR: All these things right now, you look at know is double ready, the correct thing for for this when the values range from zero to 100.

1168
02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:39.810
INSTRUCTOR: Right now, you look at this and you see law is there something better, and then, if there is then you use on the table to to change the table so that your original table will be updated with.

1169
02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:58.770
INSTRUCTOR: will be optimized in terms of the data types that you use today, so you look at each of them and then you you check true not just here but on the Internet, you know the URL they can go to yeah with a whole bunch of other things.

1170
02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:02.910
INSTRUCTOR: Right, you can check out Sola yeah.

1171
02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:04.950
INSTRUCTOR: OK.

1172
02:54:08.010 --> 02:54:09.090
INSTRUCTOR: So the second one.

1173
02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:11.460
INSTRUCTOR: process.

1174
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:18.870
STUDENT 07: So for each of those changes to be need to explain why she she felt napa why we change to the teacher.

1175
02:54:19.470 --> 02:54:25.110
INSTRUCTOR: So, so it is the same reason, then you lump them together so they are these.

1176
02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:34.710
INSTRUCTOR: Are these are Jewish groups that you attract so if you're going to change that to something else, they can still express through the absolute values, then you tell me that.

1177
02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:54.450
INSTRUCTOR: So in for your team here and with the Alpha you see what's important is the code right, so I will be creating your code, I will not be creating your result, people so whatever changes, you make to record them notice the.

1178
02:54:55.740 --> 02:54:58.890
INSTRUCTOR: Next sql statements, a user okay so.

1179
02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:05.280
INSTRUCTOR: don't don't use and truly and then you know just sent me there is off the boat that's not that's not what this is about that.

1180
02:55:06.330 --> 02:55:06.600
INSTRUCTOR: OK.

1181
02:55:06.690 --> 02:55:07.020
OK.

1182
02:55:08.850 --> 02:55:09.630
OK so.

1183
02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:19.020
INSTRUCTOR: The plan B is I want y'all to learn how to construct a table that you've seen the show.

1184
02:55:20.310 --> 02:55:31.680
INSTRUCTOR: So sometimes you know let's say you are doing this as part of your day job, one of the things reporting and then all these years people i've been using excel.

1185
02:55:32.730 --> 02:55:46.800
INSTRUCTOR: To manually come up with the tables I need to reprocess me tables, so what I want you to learn this you don't you look at a table and you say Okay, I see all the data I have all these excel sheets, I can.

1186
02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:52.440
INSTRUCTOR: Do is young people, and then I can write a sql script.

1187
02:55:53.640 --> 02:56:10.020
INSTRUCTOR: That will show me the exact same people are similar enough that like in real life, see it soon enough with the same information, then next time every reporting period the the excel excel data changes I just you know import it to my sql table and I run the same scripts.

1188
02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:21.270
INSTRUCTOR: Right, then that saves a lot of time, so you do the winds up front create the script make sure it works and then anytime new data comes in, you just chuck it in, and then we bought.

1189
02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:45.900
INSTRUCTOR: Right so i've i've been doing this for years, so one of my roles as CSS is to report metrics to me so every semester someone in the university structure will send me new new data sets I just read it into you know I put it into my database and I run the same scripts.

1190
02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:57.600
INSTRUCTOR: And then I just copy and paste into into PowerPoint or something I just sent to me right so rather than you know I do it in excel then there's always a chance of manual error and incident.

1191
02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:01.560
INSTRUCTOR: So for this question.

1192
02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:08.730
INSTRUCTOR: I want you to give me a result, stable and looks exactly like this.

1193
02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:15.300
INSTRUCTOR: So you see the percentage symbol here.

1194
02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:29.190
INSTRUCTOR: This is not 22% by two and 3.0% so all these things are important, the order that you see in you know everything needs to be identical okay.

1195
02:57:30.090 --> 02:57:45.600
INSTRUCTOR: So and it's you can do it yeah I think it's very easy for us, so you think about it in two steps first step, you create this the queries to generate the data.

1196
02:57:47.490 --> 02:58:02.610
INSTRUCTOR: Make sure that you've got the data correct then after that you look at my possible built in functions, there might be that will allow you to express the data in a very specific format.

1197
02:58:04.590 --> 02:58:05.010
yeah.

1198
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:15.690
INSTRUCTOR: I saw it.

1199
02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:17.940
INSTRUCTOR: So.

1200
02:58:18.840 --> 02:58:23.640
INSTRUCTOR: So it is, it is not here, I thought site again.

1201
02:58:25.380 --> 02:58:29.430
INSTRUCTOR: It is not here, there is very easy to go for it also yeah.

1202
02:58:44.340 --> 02:58:48.840
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so questions from the floor.

1203
02:58:50.310 --> 02:58:57.690
STUDENT 07: across a one more question so for this question be right, so the data type to me is even put it into a single statement.

1204
02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:02.220
INSTRUCTOR: For the sorry the directory.

1205
02:59:02.730 --> 02:59:08.880
STUDENT 07: So be assuming if we need to change the data type so should we change, it should be included.

1206
02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:12.330
STUDENT 07: In these are.

1207
02:59:12.810 --> 02:59:13.350
STUDENT 07: These fun.

1208
02:59:13.890 --> 02:59:22.530
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so is different, so in a used to alter table statement to change the data type of.

1209
02:59:23.610 --> 02:59:37.020
INSTRUCTOR: Your table right so with the updated table you then use the updated table in be using a select statement in a single select statement to create this table.

1210
02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:48.000
STUDENT 07: So we should be A and B somehow linked together, because the data smash the question be.

1211
02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:50.700
INSTRUCTOR: So yeah.

1212
02:59:52.740 --> 03:00:02.010
INSTRUCTOR: So you do efforts and by doing a you have altered table you have changed it to and then all the data types, not all that somebody did that to me i've changed.

1213
03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:03.690
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

1214
03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:08.280
INSTRUCTOR: And then, after that you then won't be.

1215
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:14.880
STUDENT 07: able to show the data again push me every change.

1216
03:00:15.270 --> 03:00:15.630
yeah.

1217
03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:17.430
STUDENT 07: Thank you.

1218
03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:20.310
INSTRUCTOR: So yeah so.

1219
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:28.590
INSTRUCTOR: To create the table once again right, he must be exact, so the naming of the columns awesome exact.

1220
03:00:29.940 --> 03:00:39.030
INSTRUCTOR: sequence of you know which column comes to fall, which and other all must be exactly okay so just pay attention to all this in your code.

1221
03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:43.530
INSTRUCTOR: Please document your put comments in a code.

1222
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:56.160
INSTRUCTOR: copy and paste your Code into a Microsoft word document do not embedded.

1223
03:00:57.180 --> 03:01:04.290
INSTRUCTOR: file right as a as an embedded object in Microsoft word I know that's possible so that you drag and drop some other file.

1224
03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:15.300
INSTRUCTOR: So just to let you know, for those of us who are using the MAC address when you drag and drop those embedded things we cannot see.

1225
03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:28.740
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so you shouldn't screenshot you should copy and paste a quick, because what I will do is I will copy and paste your cookie do my query browser and see whether it's all stable.

1226
03:01:30.390 --> 03:01:31.950
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so here's a screenshot I can do that.

1227
03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:34.500
INSTRUCTOR: So.

1228
03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:36.870
INSTRUCTOR: In Microsoft way.

1229
03:01:43.770 --> 03:01:44.790
INSTRUCTOR: In Microsoft way.

1230
03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:48.330
INSTRUCTOR: When you.

1231
03:01:53.550 --> 03:01:55.110
INSTRUCTOR: I think the auto correct.

1232
03:02:00.060 --> 03:02:00.540
INSTRUCTOR: Correct.

1233
03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:05.310
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, okay this thing.

1234
03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:19.530
INSTRUCTOR: Straight quotes with smack quotes so when you're copying and pasting Code into Microsoft word document this with to be unchecked.

1235
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:28.350
INSTRUCTOR: You don't want them to change your State courts into slack quotes because if you do that, and then I just.

1236
03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:33.450
INSTRUCTOR: select the entire query and I paste it into my chrome browser is not good right.

1237
03:02:34.470 --> 03:02:41.220
INSTRUCTOR: So the programming languages sql Python are all that do not understand spot quotes.

1238
03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:46.380
INSTRUCTOR: The only understand strict quips okay so make sure that.

1239
03:02:47.430 --> 03:02:49.500
INSTRUCTOR: You go into Microsoft word.

1240
03:02:51.210 --> 03:03:00.810
INSTRUCTOR: data and auto correct and auto format you type the straight quotes with smack quotes that box is checked okay.

1241
03:03:02.850 --> 03:03:08.700
INSTRUCTOR: The hyphens with dashes I think better because you know the two minus science.

1242
03:03:09.870 --> 03:03:12.690
INSTRUCTOR: And white space character starts.

1243
03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:29.520
INSTRUCTOR: A comment line right in sql so you do, I never change it to some other symbol OK so maybe these two are bought into to not have 10 switched on in Microsoft word so then.

1244
03:03:33.330 --> 03:03:34.860
INSTRUCTOR: Why couldn't you.

1245
03:03:35.970 --> 03:03:36.990
INSTRUCTOR: Type in.

1246
03:03:40.410 --> 03:03:40.950
Okay.

1247
03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:43.770
INSTRUCTOR: You can just paste yeah.

1248
03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:53.490
INSTRUCTOR: So let me increase the size of this so you know I will So if I see.

1249
03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:00.840
INSTRUCTOR: This is a strict quote.

1250
03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:07.470
INSTRUCTOR: So.

1251
03:04:10.110 --> 03:04:11.490
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so this is a great quote.

1252
03:04:17.970 --> 03:04:19.530
INSTRUCTOR: turn on auto correct.

1253
03:04:21.090 --> 03:04:22.500
INSTRUCTOR: it's true quotes spot.

1254
03:04:23.790 --> 03:04:25.200
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, if I type.

1255
03:04:26.670 --> 03:04:29.190
INSTRUCTOR: street quote you see a change.

1256
03:04:35.820 --> 03:04:42.240
INSTRUCTOR: guys you mean you know what the Defense is for people who are coding, you know so.

1257
03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:53.100
INSTRUCTOR: So this thing is different from this thing.

1258
03:04:54.390 --> 03:04:57.270
INSTRUCTOR: Right, so this thing is different from getting.

1259
03:05:00.570 --> 03:05:03.270
INSTRUCTOR: up this context.

1260
03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:19.500
INSTRUCTOR: If you have this right and you paste it, you will not change, but if you happen to go over the line and make a you know, an adjustment here and there, Microsoft what may change for the light so it's obviously to turn it off.

1261
03:05:20.670 --> 03:05:27.570
INSTRUCTOR: And you're running this for this cause la you turn it off it's not again today, and if you want yeah so.

1262
03:05:32.610 --> 03:05:37.200
INSTRUCTOR: See single quote right so just a straight line it becomes.

1263
03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:38.880
INSTRUCTOR: So symphony.

1264
03:05:40.620 --> 03:05:44.400
INSTRUCTOR: Okay, so this is Microsoft word trying to be helpful because they think that.

1265
03:05:45.480 --> 03:05:56.550
INSTRUCTOR: This looks better and this thing here this looks better than this okay by all the programming languages to not understand this.

1266
03:05:57.750 --> 03:06:00.300
INSTRUCTOR: Again, this is not this.

1267
03:06:01.680 --> 03:06:02.130
INSTRUCTOR: Okay.

1268
03:06:05.430 --> 03:06:08.520
INSTRUCTOR: So just remember to just paste it in yeah.

1269
03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:16.860
INSTRUCTOR: Any other questions, then until all the questions.

1270
03:06:19.800 --> 03:06:27.210
INSTRUCTOR: Yes, rachel's question about a year to keep the same number of few columns and focus and assessing the optimal data types, for us, yes.

1271
03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:40.710
INSTRUCTOR: That that's absolutely correct, so the only thing only thing you use other table for in part is to change the data types for the columns that you think needs to be changed, and then you tell me why Allah so you don't have to you know.

1272
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:56.190
INSTRUCTOR: Like I said earlier, you don't have to explain oh same reason, over and over again, you can see, you know for these columns because the values range from what what your India integers web, so we can use this data type thing you know you show me off the table statement for that.

1273
03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:13.140
INSTRUCTOR: don't need to display I see I just saw checks checks and your question whether or not you need to display the table after you you you run the altar table you don't need to.

1274
03:07:13.890 --> 03:07:21.180
INSTRUCTOR: write, I will look at your alter table table statements your justification for the changes and then determine whether or not you did it correctly.

1275
03:07:23.700 --> 03:07:24.210
INSTRUCTOR: So.

1276
03:07:26.670 --> 03:07:28.950
INSTRUCTOR: This is here.

1277
03:07:30.060 --> 03:07:31.860
INSTRUCTOR: y'all should get four months ago about it.

1278
03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:41.460
INSTRUCTOR: So there's no reason why you shouldn't get for lots of it, so you just read the documentation you look at the values that the whole and then you.

1279
03:07:42.240 --> 03:07:59.610
INSTRUCTOR: You construct the correct statements you know and specify the justification Okay, so these were differentiate everyone, depending on how how you could how you structure the comments that you include right.

1280
03:08:05.940 --> 03:08:13.230
INSTRUCTOR: So James asked whether or not the y'all could right now, if what you've been exposed to, I would say that.

1281
03:08:14.670 --> 03:08:16.380
INSTRUCTOR: We can wait, the values.

1282
03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:24.060
INSTRUCTOR: In the required table as well as the column names which is trivial, yes, you have.

1283
03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:40.080
INSTRUCTOR: To specify the format, you need to understand how to specify the format and i've not explicitly taught you that so, but they are built in function, so that, so you just need to search the online documentation for it to see what is appropriate.

1284
03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:44.790
INSTRUCTOR: Right, how do you specify something like this.

1285
03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:46.020
You.

1286
03:08:50.610 --> 03:08:56.130
STUDENT 07: Can just ask one more question for question be right when they say construct them for him.
